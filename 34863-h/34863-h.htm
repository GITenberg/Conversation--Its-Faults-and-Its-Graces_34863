<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">Young Ladies</span>,</div>

<p>You have made me happy by your kind invitation
to meet you, and to address you on this anniversary.
A day spent in this room at your annual
examination, nearly two years ago, was a season of
privilege and enjoyment not readily to be forgotten.
I had previously entertained a high regard for your
instructor. I then learned to know him by his work;
and, were he not here, I should be glad to extend
beyond a single sentence my congratulations with you
that you are his pupils.</p>

<p>I have said that I accepted your invitation with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
gladness. Yet, in preparing myself to meet you, I
find a degree of embarrassment. This is for you a
season of recreation,&mdash;a high festival; and I am
accustomed to use my pen and voice only on grave
occasions, and for solemn services. I know not how
to add to your amusement. Should I undertake to
make sport for you, my awkwardness would give you
more mirth than my wit. The best that I can do is to
select some subject that is or ought to be interesting
to you, and to endeavor to blend a little instruction
with the gayer and more lively notes of the occasion.
The lesson shall be neither tediously long nor needlessly
grave.</p>

<p>I propose to offer you a few hints on <i>conversation</i>.
How large a portion of life does it fill up! How
innumerable are its ministries and its uses! It is the
most refined species of recreation,&mdash;the most sparkling
source of merriment. It interweaves with a
never-resting shuttle the bonds of domestic sympathy.
It fastens the ties of friendship, and runs along the
golden links of the chain of love. It enriches charity,
and makes the gift twice blessed. There is, perhaps,
a peculiar appropriateness in the selection of this
topic for an address to young ladies; for they do
more than any other class in the community towards
establishing the general tone and standard of social
intercourse. The voices of many of you already, I
doubt not, strike the key-note of home conversation;
and you are fast approaching an age when you will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
take prominent places in general society; will be the
objects of peculiar regard; and will, in a great measure,
determine whether the social converse in your respective
circles shall be vulgar or refined, censorious or
kindly, frivolous or dignified. It was said by a wise
man of antiquity,&mdash;"Only give me the making of
songs for the people, and I care not who makes the
laws." In our unmusical age and land, talking occupies
the place which songs did among the melody-loving
Greeks; and he who could tune the many-voiced
harp of the social party, need crave no higher
office or more potent sway.</p>

<p>Permit me now to enumerate some of the characteristics
of graceful, elegant, and profitable conversation,
commencing with the lower graces, and passing
on to the higher.</p>

<p>Let me first beg you, if you would be good talkers,
to form and fix now, (for you can do this only now,)
habits of correct and easy pronunciation. The words
which you now miscall, it will cost you great pains in
after life to pronounce aright, and you will always be
in danger of returning inadvertently to your old pronunciation.
There are two extremes which you ought
equally to shun. One is that of carelessness; the
other, that of extreme precision, as if the sound of the
words uttered were constantly uppermost in the mind.
This last fault always suggests the idea of vanity and
pedantry, and is of itself enough to add a deep indigo
hue to a young lady's reputation.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>One great fault of New England pronunciation is,
that the work is performed too much by the outer
organs of speech. The tones of the voice have but
little depth. Instead of a generous play of the throat
and lungs, the throat almost closes, and the voice
seems to be formed in the mouth. It is this that
gives what is called a <i>nasal</i> tone to the voice, which,
when denied free range through its lawful avenues,
rushes in part through the nose. We notice the nasal
pronunciation in excess here and there in an individual,
while Englishmen and Southerners observe it
as a prevailing characteristic of all classes of people
in the Northern States. Southerners in general are
much less careful and accurate in pronunciation than
we are; but they more than compensate for this
deficiency by the full, round tones in which they utter
themselves. In our superficial use of the organs of
speech, there are some consonants which we are
prone to omit altogether. This is especially the case
with <i>g</i> in words that end with <i>ing</i>. Nine persons out
of ten say <i>singin</i> instead of <i>singing</i>. I know some
public speakers, and many private ones, who never
pronounce the <i>t</i> in such words as <i>object</i> and <i>prospect</i>.
Very few persons give the right sound to <i>r</i> final.
<i>Far</i> is generally pronounced as if it were written <i>fah</i>.
Now, I would not have the full Hibernian roll of the
<i>r;</i> but I would have the presence of the letter more
distinctly recognized, than it often is, even by persons
of refined and fastidious taste.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>Let me next beg you to shun all the ungrammatical
vulgarisms which are often heard, but which never
fail to grate harshly on a well-tuned ear. If you
permit yourselves to use them now, you will never
get rid of them. I know a venerable and accomplished
lawyer, who has stood at the head of his
profession in this State, and has moved in the most
refined society for half a century, who to this day
says <i>haint</i> for <i>has not</i>, having acquired the habit
when a schoolboy. I have known persons who have
for years tried unsuccessfully to break themselves of
saying <i>done</i> for <i>did</i>, and <i>you and I</i> for <i>you and me</i>.
Many well-educated persons, through the power of
long habit, persist in saying <i>shew</i> for <i>showed</i>, while
they know perfectly well that they might, with equal
propriety, substitute <i>snew</i> for <i>snowed;</i> and there is
not far hence a clergyman, marvellously precise and
fastidious in his choice of words, who is very apt to
commence his sermon by saying, "I <i>shew</i> you in a
recent discourse." A false delicacy has very generally
introduced <i>drank</i> as the perfect participle of <i>drink</i>,
instead of <i>drunk</i>, which alone has any respectable
authority in its favor; and the imperfect tense and
perfect participle have been similarly confounded in
many other cases. I know not what grammar you
use in this school. I trust that it is an old one; for
some of the new grammars sanction these vulgarisms,
and in looking over their tables of irregular verbs, I
have sometimes half expected to have the book dashed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
from my hand by the indignant ghost of Lindley
Murray. Great care and discretion should be employed
in the use of the common abbreviations of the
negative forms of the substantive and auxiliary verbs.
<i>Can't</i>, <i>don't</i>, and <i><ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'havn't'">haven't</ins></i>, are admissible in rapid conversation
on trivial subjects. <i>Isn't</i> and <i>hasn't</i> are
more harsh, yet tolerated by respectable usage. <i>Didn't</i>,
<i>couldn't</i>, <i>wouldn't</i>, and <i>shouldn't</i>, make as unpleasant
combinations of consonants as can well be
uttered, and fall short but by one remove of those
unutterable names of Polish gentlemen which sometimes
excite our wonder in the columns of a newspaper.
<i>Won't</i> for <i>will not</i>, and <i>aint</i> for <i>is not</i> or <i>are
not</i>, are absolutely vulgar; and <i>aint</i>, for <i>has not</i> or
<i>have not</i>, is utterly intolerable.</p>

<p>Nearly akin to these offences against good grammar
is another untasteful practice, into which you are
probably more in danger of falling, and which is a
crying sin among young ladies,&mdash;I mean the use of
exaggerated, extravagant forms of speech,&mdash;saying
<i>splendid</i> for <i>pretty</i>, <i>magnificent</i> for <i>handsome</i>, <i>horrid</i>
for <i>very</i>, <i>horrible</i> for <i>unpleasant</i>, <i>immense</i> for <i>large</i>,
<i>thousands</i> or <i>myriads</i> for any number greater than <i>two</i>.
Were I to write down, for one day, the conversation
of some young ladies of my acquaintance, and then to
interpret it literally, it would imply that, within the
compass of twelve or fourteen hours, they had met
with more marvellous adventures and hair-breadth
escapes, had passed through more distressing experiences,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
had seen more imposing spectacles, had endured
more fright, and enjoyed more rapture, than
would suffice for half a dozen common lives. This
habit is attended with many inconveniences. It deprives
you of the intelligible use of strong expressions
when you need them. If you use them all the time,
nobody understands or believes you when you use
them in earnest. You are in the same predicament
with the boy who cried <span class="smcap">wolf</span> so often, when there
was no wolf, that nobody would go to his relief when
the wolf came. This habit has also a very bad
moral bearing. Our words have a reflex influence
upon our characters. Exaggerated speech makes
one careless of the truth. The habit of using words
without regard to their rightful meaning, often leads
one to distort facts, to misreport conversations, and to
magnify statements, in matters in which the literal
truth is important to be told. You can never trust
the testimony of one who in common conversation is
indifferent to the import, and regardless of the power,
of words. I am acquainted with persons whose representations
of facts always need translation and correction,
and who have utterly lost their reputation for
veracity, solely through this habit of overstrained and
extravagant speech. They do not mean to lie; but
they have a dialect of their own, in which words bear
an entirely different sense from that given to them in
the daily intercourse of discreet and sober people.</p>

<p>In this connection, it may not be amiss to notice a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
certain class of phrases, often employed to fill out
and dilute sentences, such as, <i>I'm sure</i>,&mdash;<i>I declare</i>,&mdash;<i>That's
a fact</i>,&mdash;<i>You know</i>,&mdash;<i>I want to know</i>,&mdash;<i>Did
you ever?</i>&mdash;<i>Well! I never</i>,&mdash;and the like.
All these forms of speech disfigure conversation,
weaken the force of the assertions or statements with
which they are connected, and give unfavorable impressions
as to the good breeding of the person that
uses them.</p>

<p>You will be surprised, young ladies, to hear me
add to these counsels,&mdash;"Above all things, swear
not at all." Yet there is a great deal of swearing
among those who would shudder at the very thought
of being profane. The Jews, who were afraid to use
the most sacred names in common speech, were
accustomed to swear by the temple, by the altar, and
by their own heads; and these oaths were rebuked
and forbidden by divine authority. I know not why
the rebuke and prohibition apply not with full force to
the numerous oaths by <i>goodness</i>, <i>faith</i>, <i>patience</i>, and
<i>mercy</i>, which we hear from lips that mean to be
neither coarse nor irreverent, in the schoolroom, street,
and parlor; and a moment's reflection will convince
any well-disposed person, that, in the exclamation
<i>Lor</i>, the cutting off of a single letter from a consecrated
word can hardly save one from the censure
and the penalty written in the third commandment.
I do not regard these expressions as harmless. I believe
them inconsistent with Christian laws of speech.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
Nor do they accord with the simple, quiet habit of
mind and tone of feeling which are the most favorable
to happiness and usefulness, and which sit as
gracefully on gay and buoyant youth as on the sedateness
of maturer years. The frame of mind in which
a young lady says, in reply to a question, <i>Mercy! no</i>,
is very different from that which prompts the simple,
modest <i>no</i>. Were there any room for doubt, I should
have some doubt of the truth of the former answer;
for the unnatural, excited, fluttered state of mind implied
in the use of the oath, might indicate either an
unfitness to weigh the truth, or an unwillingness to
acknowledge it.</p>

<p>In fine, transparency is an essential attribute of all
graceful and becoming speech. Language ought to
represent the speaker's ideas, and neither more nor
less. Exclamations, needless expletives, unmeaning
extravagances, are as untasteful as the streamers of
tattered finery which you sometimes see fluttering
about the person of a dilapidated belle. Let your
thoughts be as strong, as witty, as brilliant, as you
can make them; but never seek to atone for feeble
thought by large words, or to rig out foolish conceits
in the spangled robe of genuine wit. Speak as you
think and feel; and let the tongue always be an honest
interpreter to the heart.</p>

<p>But it is time that we passed to higher considerations.
There are great laws of duty and religion
which should govern our conversation; and the divine<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
Teacher assures us that even for our idle words we
are accountable to Him who has given us the power
of speech. Now, I by no means believe that there is
any principle of our religion which frowns upon wit
or merriment, or forbids playful speech at fit seasons
and within due limits. The very fact that the Almighty
has created the muscles which produce the
smile and the laugh, is a perpetual rebuke to those
who would call all laughter madness, and all mirth
folly. Amusement, in its time and place, is a great
good; and I know of no amusement so refined, so
worthy an intellectual being, as that conversation
which is witty and still kind, playful, yet always reverent,
which recreates from toil and care, but leaves
no sting, and violates no principle of brotherly love or
religious duty.</p>

<p>Evil speaking, slander, detraction, gossip, scandal,
are different names for one of the chief dangers to be
guarded against in conversation; and you are doing
much towards defending yourselves against it by the
generous mental culture which you enjoy in this seminary.
The demon of slander loves an empty house.
A taste for scandal betrays a vacant mind. Furnish
your minds, then, by useful reading and study, and
by habits of reflection and mental industry, that you
may be able to talk about subjects as well as about
people,&mdash;about events too long past or too remote to
be interwoven with slander. But, if you must talk
about people, why not about their good traits and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
deeds? The truest ingenuity is that which brings
hidden excellences to light; for virtue is in her very
nature modest and retiring, while faults lie on the surface
and are detected with half an eye.</p>

<p>You will undoubtedly be careful to have your words
always just and kind, if you will only take a sufficiently
thorough view of the influence of your habits
of conversation, both in the formation of your own
characters and in determining the happiness of others.
But how low an estimate do many of us make of the
power of the tongue! How little account we are apt
to take of our words! Have we not all at times said
to ourselves, "Oh! it is only a word!" when it may
have been sharp as a drawn sword, have given more
pain than a score of blows, and done more harm than
our hands could have wrought in a month? Why is
it that the slanderer and the tale-bearer regard themselves
as honest and worthy people, instead of feeling
that they are accursed of God and man? It is because
they deal in evil words only, and they consider words
as mere nought. Why is it that the carping tongue,
which filches a little from everybody's good name,
can hardly utter itself without a sneer, and makes
every fair character its prey, thinks better of itself
than a petty pilferer would? It is because by long,
though baseless prescription, the tongue has claimed
for itself a license denied to every other member and
faculty.</p>

<p>But, in point of fact, your words not only express,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
but help create, your characters. Speech gives
definiteness and permanence to your thoughts and
feelings. The unuttered thought may fade from the
memory,&mdash;may be chased away by better thoughts,&mdash;may,
indeed, hardly be a part of your own mind;
for, if suggested from without, and met without a welcome,
and with disapproval and resistance, it is not
yours. But by speech you adopt thoughts, and the
voice that utters them is as a pen that engraves them
indelibly on the soul. If you can suppress unkind
thoughts, so that, when they rise in your breast, and
mount to your very lips, you leave them unuttered,
you are not on the whole unkind,&mdash;your better nature
has the supremacy. But if these wrong feelings
often find utterance, though you call it hasty utterance,
there is reason to fear that they flow from a
bitter fountain within.</p>

<p>Consider, also, how large a portion speech makes up
of the lives of all. It occupies the greater part of the
waking hours of many of us; while express acts of a
moral bearing, compared with our words, are rare
and few. Indeed, in many departments of duty,
words are our only possible deeds,&mdash;it is by words
alone that we can perform or violate our duty. Many
of the most important forms of charity are those of
speech. Alms-giving is almost the only expression of
charity of which the voice is not the chief minister;
and alms, conferred in silent coldness, or with chiding
or disdainful speech, freeze the spirit, though they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
may warm the body. Speech, too, is the sole medium
of a countless host of domestic duties and observances.
There are, indeed, in every community many whose
only activity seems to be in words. There are many
young ladies, released from the restraints of school,
and many older ladies, with few or no domestic burdens,
with no worldly avocation and no taste for reading,
whose whole waking life, either at their own
homes or from house to house, is given to the exercise,
for good or evil, of the tongue,&mdash;that unruly
member. And how blessed might they make that
exercise,&mdash;for how many holy ministries of love,
sympathy, and charity might it suffice,&mdash;how many
wounds might it prevent or heal,&mdash;did they only
believe and feel that they were writing out their own
characters in their daily speech! But too many of
them forget this. So long as they do not knowingly
and absolutely lie, they feel no responsibility for their
words. They deem themselves virtuous, because
they refrain from vices to which they have not the
shadow of a temptation; but carp, backbite, and carry
ill reports from house to house, with an apostle's zeal
and a martyr's devotedness. To say nothing of the
social effect of such a life, is not the tongue thus
employed working out spiritual death for the soul in
whose service it is busy? I know of no images too
vile to portray such a character. The dissection of a
slanderer's or talebearer's heart would present the
most loathsome specimen of morbid anatomy conceivable.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
It is full of the most malignant poison.
Its life is all mean, low, serpent-like,&mdash;a life that
cannot bear the light, but finds all its nourishment and
growth in darkness. Were these foul and odious
forms of speech incapable of harming others,&mdash;did
human reptiles of this class creep about in some outward
guise, in which they could be recognized by all,
and their words be taken for what they are worth,
and no more,&mdash;still I would beg them, for their own
sakes, not to degrade God's image, in which they
were created, into the likeness of a creeping thing; I
would entreat them not to be guilty of the meanest
and most miserable of all forms of spiritual suicide; I
would beseech them, if they are determined to sell
their souls, to get some better price for them than the
scorn and dread of all whose esteem is worth having.</p>

<p>In this connection, we ought to take into account
the very large class of literally idle words. How
many talk on unthinkingly and heedlessly, as if the
swift exercise of the organs of speech were the great
end of life! The most trivial news of the day, the
concerns of the neighborhood, the floating gossip,
whether good-natured or malignant, dress, food, frivolous
surmises, paltry plans, vanities too light to remain
an hour upon the memory,&mdash;these are the sole staple
of what too many call conversation; and many are
the young people who are training themselves in the
use of speech for no higher or better purpose. But
such persons have the threatened judgment visibly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
following their idle speech. Their minds grow superficial
and shallow. They constantly lose ground, if
they ever had any, as intellectual and moral beings.
Such speech makes a person, of however genteel
training, coarse and vulgar, and that not only in character,
but even in voice and manners, and with sad
frequency it obliterates traits of rich loveliness and
promise. The merely idle tongue is also very readily
betrayed into overt guilt. One cannot indulge in
idle, reckless talk, without being implicated in all the
current slander and calumny, and acquiring gradually
the envious and malignant traits of a hackneyed tale-bearer.
And the person who, in youth, can attract
the attention and win the favor of those of little reflection
by flippant and voluble discourse, will encounter
in the very same circles neglect, disesteem, and dislike,
before the meridian of life is passed; for it takes
all the charms that youth, sprightliness, and high animal
spirits can furnish, to make an idle tongue fascinating
or even endurable.</p>

<p>Let me ask you now to consider for a moment the
influence which we exert in conversation upon the
happiness or misery of others. It is not too much to
say, that most of us do more good or harm in this
way than in all other forms beside. Look around
you,&mdash;take a survey of whatever there is of social or
domestic unhappiness in the families to which you
belong, or among your kindred and acquaintance.
Nine tenths of it can be traced to no other cause than<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
untrue, unkind, or ungoverned speech. A mere harsh
word, repented of the next moment,&mdash;how great a
fire can it kindle! The carrying back and forth of
an idle tale, not worth an hour's thought, will often
break up the closest intimacies. From every slanderous
tongue you may trace numerous rills of bitterness,
winding round from house to house, and separating
those who ought to be united in the closest friendship.
Could persons, who, with kind hearts, are yet hasty
in speech, number up, at the close of a day, the feelings
that they had wounded, and the uncomfortable
sensations that they had caused, they would need no
other motive to study suavity of manner, and to seek
for their words the rich unction of a truly charitable
spirit. Then, too, how many are the traits of suspicion,
jealousy, and heart-burning, which go forth
from every day's merely idle words, vain and vague
surmises, uncharitable inferences and conjectures!</p>

<p>These thoughts point to the necessity of religion as
the guiding, controlling element in conversation. All
conversation ought to be religious. Not that I would
have persons always talking on what are commonly
called religious subjects. Let these be talked of at
fitting times and places, but never obtrusively brought
forward or thrust in. But cannot common subjects be
talked of religiously? Cannot we converse about our
plans, our amusements, our reading, nay, and our
neighbors too, and no sacred name be introduced, and
yet the conversation be strictly religious? Yes,&mdash;if<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
throughout the conversation we own the laws of honesty,
frankness, kind construction, and sincere benevolence,&mdash;if
our speech be pure, true, gentle, dignified,&mdash;if
it seek or impart information that either party
needs,&mdash;if it cherish friendly feeling,&mdash;if it give us
kinder affections towards others,&mdash;if it bring our
minds into vigorous exercise,&mdash;nay, if it barely amuse
us, but not too long, and if the wit be free from coarseness
and at no one's expense. But we should ever
bear it in mind, that our words are all uttered in the
hearing of an unseen Listener and Judge. Could we
keep this in remembrance, there would be little in our
speech that need give us shame or pain. But that
half hour spent in holding up to ridicule one who has
done you no harm,&mdash;that breathless haste to tell the
last piece of slander,&mdash;you would not want to remember
in your evening prayer. From the flippant,
irresponsible, wasteful gossip, in which so much time
is daily lost, you could not with a safe conscience
look up and own an Almighty presence.</p>

<p>Young ladies, my subject is a large one, and
branches out into so many heads, that, were I to say
all that I should be glad to say, the setting sun would
stop me midway. But it is time for me to relieve
your patience. Accept, with these fragmentary hints,
my cordial congratulations and good wishes. Life
now smiles before you, and beckons you onward.
Heaven grant that your coming days may be even
happier than you hope! To make them so is within<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
your own power. They will not be cloudless. If
you live long, disappointments and sorrows must
come. There will be steep and rough passages in
the way of life. But there is a Guide, in whose footprints
you may climb the steep places without weariness,
and tread the rough ground without stumbling.
Add to your mental culture faith in Him, and the self-consecration
of the Christian heart. Then even trials
will make you happier. When clouds are over your
way, rays from Heaven will struggle through their
fissures, and fringe their edges. Your path will be
onward and upward, ever easier, ever brighter. On
that path may your early footsteps be planted, that
the beautiful bloom of your youth may not wither and
perish, but may ripen for a heavenly harvest!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<div class='center'><span class='small'>DELIVERED AT READING, ENGLAND, DECEMBER 19, 1854,</span><br />

BY FRANCIS TRENCH.</div>


<p><span class="smcap">We</span> are all of us more or less apt to overlook that
which is continually going on around us. We omit
to make it a matter of inquiry, and reserve our attention
for that which is more rare, although of far less
importance. What is it, for instance, which, after a
course of long, sultry heat,&mdash;when the sun, day by
day, has blazed in the sky above,&mdash;what is it, I ask,
which has still preserved the verdure and freshness of
all vegetable life? Surely it has been nothing else
than the dew of heaven, gently, regularly, plenteously
falling, as each evening closed in. Nevertheless,
how little is it thought of,&mdash;how little are its benefits
acknowledged! But when the clouds gather speedily
and darkly, and perhaps unexpectedly, when the sense
of coolness spreads once more through the parched<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
atmosphere, when abundance of rain all at once descends,
then all observe the change, all notice the
beneficial results; yet perhaps they are trifling indeed
compared with those of the nightly and forgotten dew,
which has never ceased to fall, week by week, or
even month by month, during the course of the
drought. I feel no doubt that it will be acknowledged
how it is the same, the very same, in all things calling
for our observation. So, therefore, it is regarding
conversation, as a thing of every day. We flock to
hear and admire some mighty orator's address, but
we think little of and little appreciate that daily, hourly
thing which is our subject now,&mdash;I mean conversation.
But I leave you to judge which has the most
effect on our general interest, as social creatures,&mdash;which,
in the long run, has most to do with the pleasure
and the profit of all human intercourse.</p>

<p>Having made this claim on your attention, I would
now observe that the subject is one of so wide a scope
that I can do little more than present you with a few
thoughts, which I have noted down as they have risen
to my own mind, upon it. And I trust that they will
prove not entirely unacceptable, though well indeed
aware that the topic is one to which it must be very
difficult indeed to do any justice.</p>

<p>But I must first try to meet one objection, for which
I am quite prepared, namely, that conversation is not
a fit subject for a lecture at all, but should be considered
as too independent and free to have any<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
rules, principles, or guidance applied to it. This,
however, is indeed a fallacy, and may briefly be exposed
by a few such questions as those I am about to
ask. What should be more free than the sword of
the soldier in the battle-day?&mdash;than the pencil of the
artist at the mountain side?&mdash;or than the poet's song
in its upward flight? Yet who would condemn the
use of the drill, or the study of perspective, or the
rules of poetic art? No less untenable is it to maintain
that conversation can be subject to no principle,
rule, or review, without checking its free and unfettered
range. Cowper has simply summed up the
whole truth:&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Though conversation in its better part<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">May be esteemed a gift, and not an art;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Yet much depends, as in the tiller's toil,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">On culture and the sowing of the soil."</span><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>Nor shall I venture to suggest any measures which
I do not believe already well sanctioned, well honored,
and well practised too, even by many who have never
yet thought of classifying them at all. But these I
shall freely give, as my duty is, at your summons this
night.</div>

<p>Conversation may be termed or defined as "the
exchange and communication, by word, of that which
is passing in the inward mind and heart." And none
of all known creatures, except man, has this peculiar
gift. The animal tribes approach us and even surpass<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
us in many of their physical powers and capacities.
As to their capacities in the five senses of the body, I
conceive that, generally speaking, it is so; but none
of them converse, like man, in expressive words, however
they may and do comprehend one another through
inferior means. Homer has therefore defined our
race as "word-dividing men." And surely such a
capacity or power is not bestowed on us unaccompanied
by an obligation and a claim to give due
diligence how we do and how we may employ it.
Never to act thus is surely an undue disregard of our
endowment,&mdash;a virtual depreciation and contempt of
that which is at once among the most needful, the
most useful, and, at the same time, most ornamental
gifts of God to mankind.</p>

<p>As, then, it is said of real wisdom, that first "it is
pure," or free from error and wrong, so too, first of
all, right and proper conversation must be free from
everything evidently and positively inconsistent with
our duty towards God and man. It has ever been
well said that we must be just before we are generous.
The one attribute is essential and indispensable in
every transaction of life. The acts and deeds connected
with the other are comparatively undefined
and indefinable. So it is essential, it is indispensable,
that our conversation, from our own choice and deliberate
aim, should be utterly free from all things
irreverent to God and injurious to our fellow-creatures.
God's name must never be taken in vain.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
God's Word, and divine things generally, must never
be treated with any levity. No sentence must come
forth from our lips having any tendency to undermine
or subvert the principles and practices of true religion.
These are among the mere dues and obligations to
Him who gives us the faculty of speech, and enables
us to interchange conversation with our fellows; and,
beyond all doubt, hour after hour of silence and
reserve would be infinitely better&mdash;more to be desired
by any Christian&mdash;than the most entertaining and
most captivating talk of a witty but unprincipled man.
And so too, exactly, with regard to our fellow-creatures.
They too have an absolute claim on us, that
we should resolutely keep to the grand rule of speaking
to them only such things as will do them no hurt,&mdash;no
hurt to their minds, no hurt to their feelings, no
hurt to their best and true and everlasting interest.
As the words of one lead many to heaven and joy, so
too the words of another lead many to hell and woe.
Better, again I say, would it be for you to be silent as
a dumb man than to indulge carelessly and wickedly
in any such utterances. He who does it is a cruel
enemy of his fellow-creatures, however popular, however
able and attractive he may be.</p>

<p>Thus much with regard to conversation&mdash;on the
negative side. Thus much as to that nature and
character of which it must <i>not</i> be, under any circumstances.
And, having no intention to make my present
address in any degree of that more solemn and absolutely<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
serious kind, which it is my privilege so often
to employ in my profession, I will only add here that,
having now seen what it is essential and indispensable
for us to shun in conversation, so again, to aim at
pleasing God and serving our fellow-creatures is not
less needful,&mdash;not less essential, as the one grand
object and scope with which at all times we should
use and interchange it. I am sure you will all admit
that I could not rightly proceed without laying down
this broad, this sure foundation. On it we may build
the lighter superstructure; but, without laying it down,
I could not conscientiously proceed. Nay, farther, I
feel equally convinced that many would perceive at
once the deficiency, and regret it too, were I to adopt
any other course. Conversation, to be worthy of the
name at all, is not child's play. It must be dealt
with, if considered at all, as an important and substantial
thing, not as the mere toy wherewith to trifle
and sport each day and hour till we pass away to
meet that judgment where our Lord has himself declared,&mdash;"By
your words ye shall be justified, and
by your words ye shall be condemned."</p>

<p>The subject may now branch out into many and
various directions. To make a choice is the only
difficulty. One of these may lead us to notice that,
in all conversation, special attention should ever be
paid to the feelings of all present. Every subject
should be studiously avoided likely to give needless
pain, and perhaps, as it were, open the sluice-gate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
through which other observations might more plentifully
flow in from others of the company, painful to
one or more in the circle. Nothing, of course, will
teach this so much as true kindness and true sympathy
of heart; and, if this be wanting, offences of
this kind will continually abound,&mdash;yes, I am sorry
to say, will sometimes be studiously and intentionally
committed. But even the most loving and most kindly
spirit will do well to be very watchful on this point,
seeking to exercise all judgment and tact in the
matter; and even beyond this a beautiful art is sometimes
to be witnessed,&mdash;happy indeed are they who
possess it,&mdash;which turns and leads away the general
strain of talk, and that often with unperceived skill,
when approaching dangerous ground, or perhaps
already beginning to grieve or disturb another.</p>

<p>Among injurious practices in talk, the following
may perhaps be enumerated:&mdash;an overbearing vehemence,
challenging assertions, cold indifference to the
statements of others, a love of argumentation, an inclination
to regard fair liberty of mutual address as
undue license, pressure on another to express more
than he desires, all personalities which would be forbidden
by the royal law of speaking unto others as
you would like to be spoken to yourself. These and
many more transgressions, in our address one to another,
are not only of a grave, but also of a very
evident kind, and therefore on them, perhaps, there is
less need to dwell.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>Others are more subtle,&mdash;more elude the grasp of
ordinary observation. All social life, and even all
family life, if rightly carried on, requires not only
mutual forbearance in talk, but mutual sympathy too,
mutual encouragement one from the other. In families
and in society we find the old, the young; the busy
and those comparatively unemployed; the studious or
the literary, and those whose tastes are completely
different; people occupied in various professions and
trades; politicians and statesmen; soldiers and sailors;
young men and women reared up at home, with young
men and women reared up at schools and public institutions;
travellers acquainted with divers parts of the
globe, and those who never have quitted their own
land; men of the city and men of the field;&mdash;in a
word, persons and characters almost as various in the
aspect of their inward taste as the very features which
each countenance wears,&mdash;for I may venture to say
that no two persons think or feel exactly and altogether
alike. Now, whenever there is such a thing as opinion,
and whenever there is such a thing as feeling (which
is the case in all members of families, and in all
members of society with whom you can possibly live
or be thrown), there at once is, or there arises, an
immediate claim for a kind and proper treatment of
these opinions and of these feelings. They may not
be your own, they may be utterly different from your
own, but that has nothing to do with the question.
As a general rule, every one present has no less right<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
to them than you have to yours. You had better go,
like Shakspeare's Timon, altogether out of the concourse
of your fellow-creatures, if you cannot realize
this truth and apply it too. And it is in conversation
that you will ever give the chief proofs and evidences
whether you do so or not. In it there must be nothing
despotic,&mdash;nothing to give any present the idea that
you have any right to decide what his opinions, what
his tastes, what his habits, what his pursuits, should
be. You will, of course, not misunderstand me here,&mdash;not
forget that I am supposing each opinion, each
taste, each habit and pursuit, as, on the face of it,
allowable and innocent, although not yours. I repeat
it, there must be no despotism in society. Equality
must prevail as a general rule; I say a general rule,
because there are, no doubt, certain seasons and times
when the intercourse of social and of family life must
partake of that special character which is adapted to
the various relationships of man. The parent must,
at times, simply direct the child by his words. The
teacher, authoritatively, must instruct the pupil. The
master or employer must tell the employed what to
do. And occasionally, in society, the rule above laid
down will, by general consent, lie in abeyance, if it
may be so expressed. And, on certain subjects,&mdash;I
mean those whereon we are ourselves ignorant, but
others in our company are highly informed,&mdash;we
may be content to be just listeners, merely demonstrating
that sympathy and interest adequate to keep<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
up the flow of instruction from another's lips. But
intercourse of this kind scarcely can be termed conversation;
and when circumstances like these occur
in social and family life, they must be directed by
other rules not altogether applicable to our present
subject. Now, to enter with full sympathy into the
claims of all present in society for this equal right of
interchanged sentiment, and to show this feeling at
times by patient forbearance and at other times by
manifest appreciation of that which others say, is no
slight grace and gift. And here the various lessons
on the subject, which experience or observation has
taught, must be brought into play; and the information
in any way gained as to the various feelings,
habits, and tastes ordinarily entertained by people of
different ages, different professions, and different characters,
must be judiciously applied. Nor will this, in
the least, spoil free and fair discussion of any topic.
On the contrary, it will promote it. And thus that
principle will be rightly maintained which I have
endeavored to lay down and commend, viz., that
when any special opinion, feeling, or taste is expressed
in society,&mdash;I mean, of course, in a proper and legitimate
way,&mdash;it should always be treated by all
present with that measure of respect which each one
would wish exercised towards himself for his own
personal views. Just in proportion as men are boorish,
coarse, and unsocial, in the true and extensive sense
of the word, will they transgress here. Yes, even<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
put together one, ungainly tempered, from his field,
and another of the same character from his shop or
counting house, and very likely not five minutes will
elapse before one or the other will say something to
disparage those habits and tastes with which he himself
happens to be not conversant. There ensues discord
and disseverance, or, it may be, silence and separation.
But, on the other hand, just in proportion as
you are enabled to unite yourself with others through
your demeanor and words,&mdash;not, of course, hypocritically
or obsequiously, but from real sympathy
with all the innocent tastes and engagements of our
fellow-creatures,&mdash;just, I say, in proportion as you
are enabled to do this, will your intercourse with them,
in the way of conversation, be of that kind at which
we should aim. None will be afraid of your indulging
in rebuffs, or ridicule, or depreciation. None will
meet from you a cold, heartless, and repulsive indifference.
To you, and before you, the flower<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> of
each human heart (if I may so speak) will then have
a tendency to open and expand its varied forms and
hues, instead of retaining them all closed and shut
up; and many, many thoughts will be expressed to
you and before you which will never be heard, or at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
all events rarely, indeed, by those of a sneering, unsympathizing,
hard, and ungenial spirit. Thus you
will be known, or rather felt, instinctively felt, as one
who will do nothing to chill, but, on the contrary,
much to encourage that free spirit (in the best sense
of the word) which should mark and imbue all social
intercourse deserving the name at all; and you will
be welcomed by all who can appreciate good taste,
good tact, and (I will add) good feeling too,&mdash;for
that is the chief spring of all such conduct; and you
will be enabled to receive and communicate much
pleasure and profit too, wheresover you may go.</p>

<p>A word here may not be inappropriate as to what
is sometimes called "drawing a person out"&mdash;<i>i. e.</i>
leading another to tell you, or any company assembled
in your presence, what they know, what they have
seen, what they feel, what, in a word, they are able
to communicate, if so disposed and led. Now, this
drawing out is a very delicate affair. When successfully
done, it is most valuable. When the attempt
proves unsuccessful, you are very likely to lose or
interfere with the very object in view. Questioning
of all kinds,&mdash;up from that on the simplest topic, and
with a purpose of the simplest kind, to that involving
the most important results,&mdash;questioning, I say, of all
kinds, requires judgment and tact. Many persons
much err in this department of address. Some err
by asking about matters on which it is quite clear that
they have no real feeling and concern. Some err by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
demands as to your own personal proceedings, wherewith
they have no connection. Some, again, err by
putting questions, not wrongly or inappropriately, but
merely too many at a time, or in too rapid a succession.
This scarcely can be called conversation at all,&mdash;and,
generally speaking, (though I do not deny
that there are exceptions, which will at once recur to
the intelligent,) yes, generally speaking, is most unsatisfactory.
And the reason, if we analyze the
matter, is, that all the statements, or observations, or
call them what you will, proceed, under such circumstances,
from one of the parties engaged. It is not
reciprocal; it is not mutually communicated with due
equality of interchanged thought. You will at once
perceive that this must be detrimental; and I would
suggest that when you may observe the damage which
is thus done to conversation, you should seek at once
to put the discourse on a better plan,&mdash;to shift it, as
it were, on a better line for good progress. And that
may sometimes be done by putting a question to
those who question you, or even more, by making the
number of questions on each side, in some measure,
to correspond. This, of course, must not be done
harshly or abruptly, nor so as to give the very least
impression that you yourself desire to withhold and
draw in; but it may often be advantageously done;
and you will thus afford to another the natural and fit
means of telling you something, as a response for that
which you tell him. Then true conversation will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
begin; then the due interchange of expression, which
alone merits the name; then each party becomes
rightly placed, and the intercourse will improve almost
instantaneously.</p>

<p>But if, in these very commonest forms of our
mutual address, it is not an easy thing to put questions
well,&mdash;neither too many, nor in their wrong place,&mdash;then
we may be well assured that it is more difficult
still when the object, expressly, is to lead on
another, gifted perhaps in many ways, or having perhaps
some special thing to tell, unknown to you or
others present. And yet what a valuable art this is!
Much is lost in society by incapacity for its due exercise.
Much is gained by skill in its employment.
But many reasons concur to render it very difficult.
The following may be mentioned among many others.
Some are full of matter, but shy or reserved. Some
are unaware of the deep interest which certain things,
well known to them, would have for others, if they
would communicate them; (in illustration of this, I
may perhaps quote scientific men, travellers, those
who have led strange and peculiar lives.) Some are
too modest to put themselves in any prominent light.
Others are too proud so to do, lest they should fail in
winning full attention to their words. Some are jaded
and worn with previous hours of intellectual toil, and
the current of their thoughts is still flowing on in a
channel of its own. Some are laboring under a kind
of awe of one or more persons in the company.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
Some are young, and scarcely seem to realize or
know how acceptable are the thoughts and fresh expressions
of youth to those of maturer years. Others
are afraid of being too professional in their remarks.
Others are indolent in the use of their tongue and
utterance. And numerous other causes might be
mentioned, which sadly interfere with the full, free,
and general flow of discourse or conversation. And
yet, at the same time, there may be rich stores in the
assembly,&mdash;much, very much, to communicate,&mdash;something,
at least, in each either to please, or inform
and improve,&mdash;something perhaps in every one present
which, if told and expressed to those around him,
would add and contribute no slight nor unprized contribution
to the common stock. But how to elicit it&mdash;there
is the difficulty. Nevertheless, very much
may be done by tact and kindness, by animation and
by cordiality, by watching and waiting for fit opportunities,
by that appreciation of each one in the circle
which will encompass and arouse all, as it were, with
a kind of electric chain,&mdash;by a constant and deliberate
aim to converse yourself at the time when it may
be requisite, and willingly to lapse into silence and
the background when another takes up the subject.
And, although it is a measure which requires no little
taste and moderation in its use, still it is sometimes
not only very graceful, but very effectual too, if you
will open out on some few personal topics which may
concern yourself, and thus win a response from others<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
present, who may personally know or have personally
gone through that which you and others in the company
would desire, and rightly desire, to hear opened
out without any reserve.</p>

<p>In order, again, to promote conversation of a superior
sort, endeavor must be made to expand and enlarge
its bounds to the very utmost. It should be of a comprehensive
kind,&mdash;not the gossip of some narrow set,
not a mere comment on the persons and affairs of any
one locality, not a wearisome and dull repetition of
things already, perhaps long, familiar to all present.
I repeat, it should be comprehensive,&mdash;brought forward,
as it were, from a full treasury of "things new
and old," and coined into various sums, larger for
such occasions as may need, and small&mdash;yes, even
to the smallest&mdash;for the fit use and time. It should
be formed of various materials, of that which has
been seen, and heard, and read. A monotonous character
is fatal to it. At one time it should arouse and
awaken,&mdash;at another it should calm and soothe. At
one time it should lead into deep and grave questions,&mdash;at
another it should play lightly over the surface of
things. At one time it may touch the spirit of the
hearer, almost into tears,&mdash;at another it may raise
the full freedom of laughter and mirth. At one time
it may be addressed to all within the convenient reach
of your words,&mdash;at another to one listening ear. If
possible, it should touch on many tastes, on many
places, on various interests, giving to each present<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
(however different each taste and character) the best
and fairest opening for a share in the circling talk,
which opportunity every one, at fit occasion and turn,
should be willing to embrace, and thus to render his
or her social dues to those who freely and fairly contribute
theirs. No one, on the other hand, should
seek dominion, nor ever two or three, over the remainder.
Again, conversation should never be allowed
so to fall into separate or little knots, that one here or
one there should remain alone or excluded altogether.
It should be carried on in appropriate tones of voice.
They should be somewhat raised, or rather, I would
say, strengthened for the old and for those who are a
little deaf, of whom there are many. This, however,
not too obviously; not to remind any of infirmity.
They should be quick, firm, and spirited for those in
middle age, with their faculties in full strength. They
should be somewhat gentler to the young, lest they be
at all checked; and somewhat slower, that they may
have more time and means to frame their own answer.
For which the reason is, that as "practice makes perfect"
in all things, so they, whose practice has, of
course, been less than their seniors', need more time
to make up for the want of it, even in conversation.
At all times discourse is liable to alternations as to its
interest and life. Expect this, and even should it
become at any moment what is called dull, or even
should an awkward pause and silence come on, do not
seem to notice it. This will only make it worse.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
Rather try yourself to gather up the broken thread, or
to introduce some new matter. Every one should
avoid bringing forward or needlessly dwelling on any
topic whatsoever likely to affect any others present
with any unfavorable reminiscences. The wealthy
will avoid, as a general rule, allusions to their property
and wealth before any persons who, although their
equals in society, are known to be of poor and inadequate
estate. The healthy and the vigorous of frame
will not forget that others are invalids; those free as
air in the disposition of their time, that others have
but very little, and that with difficulty spared; the
quick and intelligent, that others are more slow in
apprehension; those of hardy spirit, well strung and
braced, that others are nervous, sensitive, and tried
by words, tones, gestures, and expressions, which
would not try, nor vex, or affect them in the least
degree. But what tact is requisite in all this! And
many, many failures must there be; sins of commission
and of omission too, even among those who earnestly
seek in this matter to fulfil, always and everywhere,
the rules of true courtesy, and, which is better
still, the rules of true Christian love. Nevertheless,
the aim at which we point is by no means without its
value as a profitable exercise both of the mind and
heart. No, nor is it ineffectual and unblessed. For,
although at times words may be said which we would
long to <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'recal'">recall</ins>, and strings of feeling touched by our
utterance which afterthought tells us we should not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
have moved, and topics handled with much want of
that skill and judgment which we should have wished
most truly to employ, still, with a good aim before us,
and with right principles in some measure realized,
and seeking to correct any error when discovered, as
well as to advance more in all which improves and
adorns right social intercourse, much will be done
towards the goodly end. And large indeed will be
the amount of pleasure and of benefit which you may
thus hope to reap for yourself and communicate to
others in the course of your life, and that, too, up to
an age, should your days be prolonged, when you
may be shut up, or at all events much restrained,
from many other means of active usefulness. For
the mellowed wisdom of age, showing and expressing
itself in that charity and sympathy for all which nothing
less than experience itself has taught, is indeed a
strong and beautiful thing.</p>

<p>Hitherto I have spoken altogether on conversation
with those whose rank and position of life corresponds
with your own. A few words now on conversation,
first, with those of a higher rank, and, secondly, with
those in the humbler conditions of life&mdash;to use the
common phrase; and every man should be qualified
and prepared for any and for all kinds of association.</p>

<p>To those of a higher rank than ourselves we may,
without derogating in the least from our independence
and self-respect, show that deference which not only
the customs of all nations, but the Scripture also<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
most evidently inculcates. This, of course, will appear
when engaged with them in conversation. It
will, however, be shown rather in some occasional
acknowledgment than in the manner or matter of discourse.
The rank of another does not in the least
demand that you should surrender your opinion to his,
nor conceal your sentiments, nor assume any other
line of subjects and topics than you would address to
those more immediately your equals in worldly position.
A vague, undefined notion seems to float through
each rank of society in our land, that those in the
stage above think, feel, and act in a manner different
from those below. A very great mistake this, which
oftentimes chills and checks and mars all open freedom
of address when one of an higher and one of a
lower rank are brought into those circumstances where
the opportunity for conversation occurs, if not the
absolute claim. But let it be remembered that the
mind and heart of man or of woman varies but little
through these mere distinctions of the world. I do
not say that it does not vary at all, but very little.
The main current of joy, the main current of sorrow,
is the same in all classes, though the lesser streams
may variously and separately flow. The main current
of affections, of interests, is the same. All are
subject to the same need of kind, friendly sympathy;
all are made to interchange thought; all share in the
manifold impressions of our common nature. Wealth
and nobility, and rank and station, are, after all, only<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
artificial things, not the main staple of life in any
man or woman. When, therefore, you are brought
into the society of one or more like these, be to them
appropriately courteous. Acknowledge their position
at once, and then let your intercourse with them flow
freely on, just as with others. Trouble not them, nor
trouble yourself, with any other system of address.
Deprive not them, nor deprive yourself, of free, open,
natural communication. And, depend upon it, that
acting and speaking thus, you will not only be oftentimes
pleased rather than silenced and embarrassed
by such society, but you will be sure to please and to
be valued,&mdash;yes, and to meet no less friendly sympathy,
both of mind and heart, than is to be found in
each other rank of life.</p>

<p>And now a few words on conversation with our
poorer friends or neighbors, or any persons in this
class of life with whom, habitually, we may have to
do, or whom we may meet at any time or place.
And few of that class being, I conclude, here, I may
speak to you as those who would gladly receive any
hints for kind consideration as to the right way of
fulfilling your own part in this matter. For I, too,
would wish to be a learner on it, so important do I
conceive it to be. So much has been said, and so
much has been written, on the benefit of free, kindly
intercourse between the rich and the poor, the employers
and the employed, those who labor with their
heads and those who labor with their hands, that any<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
mere general or vague observations on the subject
would be quite out of place here. I shall, accordingly,
regard you not only as admitting this truth, but also
as desirous yourselves to exemplify it; and, again, as
admitting, and feeling too, that merely to pay wages,
and to give directions and commands, and to bestow
alms, and to support charitable institutions (however
needful and good such things may be), is not enough
for one desiring to secure the sympathy and love of
his poorer brethren. For that you must be ready,
willing, able to converse with them. To qualify yourself
for doing this, is in many professions an indispensable
and most evident duty,&mdash;for instance, with
the ministers of religion and with medical men. They
could do nothing without such conversation. And,
considering it due at proper seasons from every one
in a higher class of life to those below them, I shall
just offer you a few hints, which seem to me not unworthy
of note. Avoid, then, on the one hand, all
hard, overbearing address; while, on the other, there
must be energy, spirit, firmness, and life. Avoid all
semblance of patronage and condescension, but at the
same time never make any forced attempts to appear
what you are not, or to assume a character not your
own. Do not imagine the range of subjects small;
and, when you can, choose those topics in which you
and those addressed both take an interest. Many
there are common to all classes. Be not impatient to
come to a point too quick, but give people a full<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
opportunity to express themselves in their own way;
nor count this waste time. It is very much otherwise.
Use short rather than long sentences,&mdash;language colloquial,
not that of books,&mdash;giving emphasis, tone,
and strength to your words,&mdash;never lapsing into
cold, lifeless, inexpressive tones. Trust oftentimes,
in conversation with the poor and comparatively uneducated,
that there is much more intelligence within
than the answer which they make in words would
lead you, at first sight, to expect. Be willing and
ready to tell something about yourself, your family,
and concerns, when there appears any interest about
them. Remember that family ties and affections are
strong in one as in another of the human family;
and, as among your own friends and associates you
would refer to these natural topics, so do here. Let
wants and necessities, and trials and difficulties, not
be forgotten, but let them not be the whole subject-matter
of discourse. No, let it range far more widely,
far more attractively; and your looks and your demeanor,
and your tones and words, being all directed
by good will, and by practice too, you indeed will be
no idler in good works during times and occasions
thus employed. You will win much love, much
esteem, much appreciation; you will hear much right
feeling expressed, and, at times, much to inform you
of a practical kind. You will do good and receive
good too.</p>

<p>It appears to me that I have now presented to your<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
notice almost a sufficiency of topics, relative to conversation,
for one single lecture. Nevertheless, I feel
unwilling to conclude without drawing your attention
to a few facts connected with the subject. One is,
that the ablest and mightiest authors of all times and
countries have borne their strong testimony to the
attraction which conversation presents, by casting a
large portion of their writings into this form or mould.
Thus did Homer in poetry, Plato in philosophy, and
dramatists, of all ages, in their plays. Thus did
Cicero in his various treatises; and Horace appears<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a>
talking to you in many and many a page. Dante's
grand poem, "Il Purgatorio," is chiefly a conversation.
The French have ever excelled in such writings; and
of such a character is that well-known gem in the
literature of Spain, I of course allude to "Don Quixote."
In Shakspeare and Walter Scott it is the same,
and they, perhaps, are the most popular writers of our
land, except one. Who, do you ask, is that? John
Bunyan, the author of the "Pilgrim's Progress;" but
that very book comes up with its testimony too, being
a dialogue throughout,&mdash;rich in pathos and wit, rich
in illustration, rich in experience, rich in all variety
and combination,&mdash;in a word, the very perfection of
talk; not less attractive than it is weighty, not less<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
entertaining than heavenly, holy, and full of all things
which make a book precious.</p>

<p>But another book there is, of which it is well
said:&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
"A glory gilds the sacred page,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Majestic like the sun!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">It gives a light to every age;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">It gives, but borrows none."</span><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>And in that book of books there are four short but
most mighty narratives. And each of those narratives
contains the one most important record which
ever had to be told upon this earth. Each of them
gives one concurrent history; namely, that of the life
of our Lord Jesus Christ, with his sayings and his
deeds. And of conversation these holy narratives are
full. God has chosen this mode of reaching our minds
and influencing our hearts, by large&mdash;very large&mdash;portions
of them written after this fashion. Cowper
felt this so deeply, that, in his poem on our present
subject, he has beautifully told and paraphrased all
that went on when Jesus met and talked with the two
disciples on the way to Emmaus. Moreover, in those
gospels, there is one, penned by that "disciple whom
Jesus loved;" and if there is much conversation in
all four of them, in it especially&mdash;in the gospel of
St. John&mdash;conversation appears in all its full and
continued glory. Take one or two examples. Mankind,
all mankind, had to be taught about the complete
atonement for our sins made by our Saviour on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
cross. Where is it more clearly, more mightily told
than in the third chapter of St. John's gospel? But
what is that chapter? Is it a law prescribed in set
terms?&mdash;No. Is it a sermon?&mdash;No. Is it a mere
address?&mdash;No. You will all remember it is a conversation,&mdash;Christ's
conversation with Nicodemus by
night. And so it is again in the very next chapter,
where a subject of no less importance&mdash;I say it advisedly,
no less importance&mdash;is set forth, viz. the
work of the Holy Spirit in man's heart; and that is
portrayed for us in a conversation with the woman of
Samaria, at Sychar's well. What striking instances
are these! And many others might be added to
them. And thus we have before us even the sanction
and proof from the Word of God, that the most mighty
and transcendent truth can reach us in no better form
than that which conversation gives, and also that Jesus
Christ put his own royal stamp of glory on it, by employing
it Himself continually, when upon the earth
among men, though he was their Lord and their God.</div>

<p>Having thus been led on,&mdash;I think very naturally,
and, as I think, quite appropriately, too, for one of
my office and position, at any time or place, or on
any subject,&mdash;I will not return to any lighter theme.
I do not in the least regret that I have selected my
present topic out of very many which suggested themselves
to my mind, when I was asked to exercise the
privilege of thus addressing you, as I have now done
for these four years. I might have chosen others far<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
more entertaining, and, no doubt, some far more
kindling and exciting at this present time,<a name="FNanchor_C_3" id="FNanchor_C_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a> when our
thoughts and our feelings are all so concentrated on
one distant spot of strife and of contest, and of danger,
and of bravery, and wounds, and deaths, and bereavements,&mdash;and
amidst all, of honor unexampled to our
brave brethren in arms. But, for many reasons, I
have done otherwise. I have chosen, as usual, a subject
of general, of national, of wide-world, of never-failing
interest, from day to day, from week to week,
from month to month, from year to year, among the
vast race of our fellows,&mdash;born social creatures,
born for mutual sympathy, with interchanged utterance,
speech, and conversation. Strongly do I feel
its importance, and I cannot help expressing my surprise
that so little, so very little, has systematically
been written or said upon it. I have found it no ordinary
theme, I assure you; and, though it is one on
which we all instinctively are interested in any circle,
or with whomsoever we may at any time be, still it is
not one on which the arrangement and classification
of thought is an easy thing. I therefore shall not feel
disappointed, nor, do I trust, will you be disappointed
either, in that good employment of your time which
you have a right to expect from me, as your lecturer
to-night here, if I shall have set before you any
thoughts, for your attention, which may improve, in
the least degree, the course and the current of ordinary<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
conversation. When we remember how much
of our innocent gratification,&mdash;how much of our daily
harmony one with another,&mdash;how much of our mutual
improvement,&mdash;depends on the right exercise of
this goodly gift,&mdash;then, I am sure, you will not consider
that the subject is one to be neglected or ignored.
I verily believe that I do not over-state the fact, in
asserting that for one time when we are liable to hurt,
or distress, or offend another by our acts and deeds,
there are fifty or an hundred, or perhaps more, occasions,
when we are liable to do so by our words, and
demeanor, and utterance. And again, for once that
we can do kind and profitable actions to those around
us, and associating with us, there are fifty or an hundred,&mdash;perhaps
more occasions still,&mdash;when we can
please or profit another by our words. I ask you, as
those who can judge in this matter for yourselves, "Is
it not so? Is it not so most undeniably?" Well,
then, if I have been successful in laying down any
right principles, in exposing anything disadvantageous,
or in presenting any available means for rendering
your daily intercourse more evidently kind, more
evidently sympathizing, more evidently, in a word,
such as that which every good man would wish to
exhibit, and which must render him not only welcome
and not only useful, but a real and true ornament
of society in the best sense of the word; if I
have shown you anything whatever available to this
end, whether for your use at home or abroad, in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
cottage or the shop, in the humblest abode or in the
noblest and in the wealthiest, then surely I shall not
have spoken in vain. I speak on no narrow topic,
and I speak for all. Truly it is one which touches all;
and in this lies its strength and its interest. There is
no one, I believe, who does not intuitively and instinctively
feel either his gain or his loss in conversation,&mdash;the
effect of it on his own mind and on his own
feelings at the time and afterwards,&mdash;either its harms
or its charms. All must feel this, though unable perhaps
to classify their thoughts or express them on it,
and perhaps they have never thought of so doing.
And I, for one, will not hesitate to say that, it having
been my lot to mix much, and willingly, in all the
various classes of society,&mdash;and having endeavored,
so far as in my power has been, to cultivate and show
a true brotherly and friendly spirit, both to high and
low,&mdash;I have met nothing to confer more pleasure
and more advantage in daily life than fit conversation.
I have found it from the poorest. I have found it
from those of middle station. I have found it among
the noble and the rich. And, while without it the
hours of social and of family life may drag on heavily,
and in a wearisome and worthless way, under the
roofs of splendor and magnificence, and in the midst
of feasts, and pomp, and parade, with it, freely interchanged
from well-informed heads and cordial hearts,
expressing what they know and telling what they feel,
without any restraint except that of love, and tact, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
propriety,&mdash;with it, I say, the simplest home may be
one of enjoyment and improvement every recurring
day, and each coming guest will share its attractions,&mdash;and
therefore I say to every one present, "Despise
not this gift, and try to improve it; and seek Divine
help for its right regulation, as well as for its use;
and be well assured that, under God's blessing, in its
direction you will gain for yourself, and promote for
your fellow-creatures, no slight share of true enjoyment,
no slight benefits both for this world and for the
world to come."</p>

<h2>PART III.</h2>


<h2>A WORD TO THE WISE;</h2>


<div class='center'>BY<br />

PARRY GWYNNE.</div>




<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>A WORD TO THE WISE.</h2>



<h2>INTRODUCTION.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is readily acknowledged, by all well educated
foreigners, that English Grammar is very easy to
learn, the difficulties of the language lying in the
numberless variations and licenses of its pronunciation.
Since to us then, children of the soil, pronunciation
has no difficulties to offer, is it not a reproach
that so many speak their own language in an inelegant
and slatternly manner,&mdash;either through an inexcusable
ignorance of grammatical rules, or a wanton violation
of them? There are two sorts of bad speakers,&mdash;the
educated and the uneducated. I write for the
former, and I shall deal the less leniently with them,
because "where much is given, much will be expected."
Ay, and where much has been achieved
too, and intellectual laurels have been gathered, is it
not a reproach that a <i>slatternly</i> mode of expression
should sometimes deteriorate from the eloquence of
the scholar, and place the accomplished man or
woman, in <i>this</i> respect, on a level with the half-educated
or the illiterate?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>Some one, I think it is Lord Chesterfield, has wisely
said, "Whatever is worth doing, is worth doing well."
Then, if our native language is worth studying, surely
it is worth <i>speaking well</i>, and as there is no standing
still in excellence of any kind, so, even in language,&mdash;in
so simple a thing as the expression of our
thoughts by words,&mdash;if we do not improve we shall
retrograde.</p>

<p>It is a common opinion that a knowledge of Latin
supersedes the necessity of the study of English grammar.
This must entail a strong imputation of carelessness
on our Latin students, who sometimes commit
such solecisms in English as make us regret they did
not <i>once</i>, at least, peruse the grammatical rules of
their native language.</p>

<p>We laugh at the blunders of a foreigner, but perpetrate
our own offences with so much gravity that an
observer would have a right to suppose we consider
them what they really are,&mdash;<i>no laughing matter</i>.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>


<div class='center'>I.</div>

<p>Some people speak of "so many <i>spoonsfull</i>," instead
of "so many spoonfuls." The rule on this
subject says: "Compounds ending in <i>ful</i>, and all
those in which the principal word is put last, form the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
plural in the same manner as other nouns,&mdash;as 'handfuls,
spoonfuls, mouthfuls,'" &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

<p>Logic will demonstrate the propriety of this rule.
Are you measuring by a plurality of spoons? If so,
"so many <i>spoonsfull</i>" must be the correct term; but
if the process of measuring be effected by <i>refilling the
same spoon</i>, then it becomes evident that the precise
idea meant to be conveyed is, the <i>quantity</i> contained
in the vessel by which it is measured, which is a
"<i>spoonful</i>."</p>


<div class='center'><br />II.</div>

<p>It is a common mistake to speak of "a disagreeable
effluvia." This word is <i>effluvium</i> in the singular, and
<i>effluvia</i> in the plural. The same rule should be observed
with <i>automaton</i>, <i>arcanum</i>, <i>erratum</i>, <i>phenomenon</i>,
<i>memorandum</i>, and several others which are less
frequently used, and which change the <i>um</i> or <i>on</i> into
<i>a</i>, to form the plural. It is so common a thing, however,
to say <i>memorandums</i>, that I fear it would sound
a little pedantic, in colloquial style, to use the word
<i>memoranda;</i> and it is desirable, perhaps, that custom
should make an exception of this word, as well as of
<i>encomium</i>, and allow two terminations to it, according
to the taste of the speaker and the style of the discourse,&mdash;<i>memorandums</i>
or <i>memoranda</i>, like <i>encomiums</i>
or <i>encomia</i>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>


<div class='center'><br />III.</div>

<p>We have heard <i>pulse</i> and <i>patience</i> treated as pluralities,
much to our astonishment.</p>


<div class='center'><br />IV.</div>

<p>It seems to be a position assumed by all grammarians,
that their readers already understand the
meaning of the word "case," as applied to nouns and
pronouns; hence they never enter into a clear explanation
of the simple term, but proceed at once to a
discussion of its grammatical distinctions, in which it
frequently happens that the student, for want of a
little introductory explanation, is unable to accompany
them. But I am not going to repeat to the
scholar how the term "case" is derived from a Latin
word signifying "to fall," and is so named because
all the other cases <i>fall</i> or <i>decline</i> from the nominative,
in order to express the various relations of nouns to
each other,&mdash;which in Latin they do by a difference
of termination, in English by the aid of prepositions,&mdash;and
that an orderly arrangement of all these different
terminations is called the declension of a noun,
&amp;c. I am not going to repeat to the scholar the
things he already knows; but to you, my gentle
readers, to whom Latin is still an unknown tongue, to
whom grammars are become obsolete things, and
grammatical definitions would be bewildering preliminaries,
"more honored in the breach than in the
observance,"&mdash;to you I am anxious to explain, in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
clearest manner practicable, all the mysteries of this
case, because it was a cruel perplexity to myself in
days of yore. And I will endeavor to make my lecture
as brief and clear as possible, requesting you to
bear in mind that no knowledge is to be acquired
without a little trouble; and that whosoever may consider
it too irksome a task to exert the understanding
for a <i>short</i> period, must be content to remain in inexcusable
and irremediable ignorance. Though, I
doubt not, when you come to perceive how great the
errors are which you daily commit, you will not
regret having sat down quietly for half an hour to
listen to an unscholastic exposition of them.</p>


<div class='center'><br />V.</div>

<p>We all understand the meaning of the word "case,"
as it is applied to the common affairs of life; but
when we meet with it in our grammars, we view it as
an abstruse term. We will not consent to believe that
it means nothing more than <i>position of affairs</i>, <i>condition</i>,
or <i>circumstances</i>, any one of which words
might be substituted for it with equal propriety, if it
were not indispensable in grammar to adhere strictly
to the same term when we wish to direct the attention
unerringly to the same thing, and to keep the understanding
alive to the justness of its application; whilst
a multiplicity of names to one thing would be likely
to create confusion. Thus, if one were to say, "This
is a very hard case," or "A singular case occurred<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
the other day," or "That poor man's case is a very
deplorable one," we should readily comprehend that
by the word "case" was meant "circumstance" or
"situation;" and when we speak, in the language of
the grammar, of "a noun in the nominative case,"
we only mean a person or thing placed in such circumstances
as to become merely named, or named as
the performer of some action,&mdash;as "the man," or
"the man walks." In both these sentences, "man"
is in the nominative case; because in the first he is
simply <i>named</i>, without reference to any circumstance
respecting him, and in the second he is named as the
performer of the <i>act</i> of <i>walking</i> mentioned. When
we speak of a noun in the possessive case, we simply
mean a person or thing placed under such circumstances
as to become named as the <i>possessor</i> of something;
and when we speak of a noun in the objective
case, we only intend to express a person or thing
standing in such a situation as to be, in some way or
other, affected by the act of some other person or
thing,&mdash;as "Henry teaches Charles." Here Henry
is, by an abbreviation of terms, called <i>the nominative
case</i>, (instead of the <i>noun</i> in the nominative case,)
because he stands in that situation in which it is incumbent
on us to name him as the <i>performer</i> of the
act of teaching; and Charles is, by the same abbreviating
license, called the <i>objective case</i>, because he
is in such a position of affairs as to <i>receive</i> the act of
teaching which Henry performs. I will now tell you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
how you may always distinguish the three cases.
Read the sentence attentively, and understand accurately
what the nouns are represented as doing. If
any person or thing be represented as <i>performing</i> an
<i>action</i>, that person or thing is a noun in the nominative
case. If any person or thing be represented as
<i>possessing something</i>, that person or thing is a noun in
the possessive case. And if any person or thing be
represented as neither performing nor possessing, it is
a noun in the objective case, whether directly or indirectly
affected by the action of the nominative; because,
as we have in English but <i>three</i> cases, which
contain the substance of the <i>six Latin</i> cases, <i>whatever
is neither nominative nor possessive must be objective</i>.
Here I might wander into a long digression on passive
and neuter verbs, which I may seem to have totally
overlooked in the principle just laid down; but I am
not writing a grammar,&mdash;not attempting to illustrate
the various ramifications of grammatical laws to people
who know nothing at all about them,&mdash;any more
than I am writing for the edification of the accomplished
scholar, to whom purity of diction is already
familiar. I am writing, chiefly, for that vast portion
of the educated classes who have never looked into a
grammar since their school days were over, but who
have ingeniously hewn out for themselves a middle
path between ignorance and knowledge, and to whom
certain little hillocks in their way have risen up, under
a dense atmosphere, to the magnitude of mountains.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
I merely wish to give to them, since they will not
take the trouble to search for themselves, one broad
and general principle, unclogged by exceptions, to
guide them to propriety of speech; and should they
afterwards acquire a taste for grammatical disputation,
they will of course apply to more extensive sources
for the necessary qualifications.</p>


<div class='center'><br />VI.</div>

<p>It is scarcely possible to commit any inaccuracy in
the use of these cases when restricted to nouns, but in
the application of them to pronouns a woful confusion
often arises; though even in this confusion exists a
marked distinction between the errors of the ill-bred
and those of the well-bred man. To use the objective
instead of the nominative is a <i>vulgar</i> error; to use the
nominative instead of the objective is a <i>genteel</i> error.
No person of decent education would think of saying,
"Him and me are going to the play." Yet how
often do we hear even well educated people say,
"They were coming to see my brother and <i>I</i>,"&mdash;"The
claret will be packed in two hampers for Mr. Smith
and <i>I</i>,"&mdash;"Let you and <i>I</i> try to move it,"&mdash;"Let
him and <i>I</i> go up and speak to them,"&mdash;"Between
you and <i>I</i>," &amp;c. &amp;c.;&mdash;faults as heinous as that of the
vulgarian who says, "Him and me are going to the
play," and with less excuse. Two minutes' reflection
will enable the scholar to correct himself, and a little
exercise of memory will shield him from a repetition<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
of the fault; but, for the benefit of those who may
<i>not</i> be scholars, we will accompany him through the
mazes of his reflections. Who are the persons that
are performing the act of "coming to see"? "<i>They</i>."
Then the pronoun <i>they</i> must stand in the nominative
case. Who are the persons to whom the act of
"coming to see" extends? "My brother and I."
Then "my brother and I," being the <i>objects affected</i>
by the act of the nominative, must be a noun and
pronoun standing in the objective case; and as nouns
are not susceptible of change on account of cases, it
is only the <i>pronoun</i> which requires alteration to render
the sentence correct: "They were coming to see my
brother and <i>me</i>." The same argument is applicable
to the other examples given. In the English language,
the imperative mood of a verb is never conjugated
with a pronoun in the nominative case, therefore,
"Let you and <i>I</i> try to move it," "Let him and <i>I</i> go
up and speak to them," are manifest improprieties.
A very simple test may be formed by taking away
the first noun or pronoun from the sentence altogether,
and bringing the verb or preposition right against that
pronoun which you use to designate yourself: thus,
"They were coming to see <i>I</i>," "The claret will be
packed in two hampers for <i>I</i>," "Let <i>I</i> try to move
it," &amp;c. By this means your own ear will correct
you, without any reference to grammatical rules.
And bear in mind that the number of <i>nouns</i> it may be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
necessary to press into the sentence will not alter the
<i>case</i> respecting the pronouns.</p>

<p>"Between you and I" is as erroneous an expression
as any. Change the position of the pronouns, and
say, "Between I and you;" or change the sentence
altogether, and say, "Between I and the wall there
was a great gap;" and you will soon see in what
case the first person should be rendered. "Prepositions
govern the objective case," therefore it is impossible
to put a nominative <i>after</i> a preposition without
a gross violation of a rule which ought to be familiar
to everybody.</p>


<div class='center'><br />VII.</div>

<p>The same mistake extends to the relative pronouns
"who" and "whom." We seldom hear the objective
case used either by vulgar or refined speakers.
"Who did you give it to?" "Who is this for?" are
solecisms of daily occurrence; and when the objective
"whom" <i>is</i> used, it is generally put in the wrong
place; as, "The person whom I expected would purchase
that estate," "The man whom they intend shall
execute that work." This intervening verb in each
sentence, "I expected" and "they intend," coming
between the last verb and its own nominative (the
relative pronoun), has no power to alter the rule, and
no right to violate it; but as the introduction of an intervening
verb, in such situations, is likely to beguile
the ear and confuse the judgment, it would be better<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
to avoid such constructions altogether, and turn the
sentence in a different way; as, "The person whom I
expected <i>to be</i> the purchaser of that estate," "The
man whom they intend <i>to</i> execute that work." If the
reader will cut off the intervening verb, which has
nothing to do with the construction of the sentence,
except to mystify it, he will perceive at a glance the
error and its remedy: "The person <i>whom</i> would
purchase that estate," "The man <i>whom</i> shall execute
that work."</p>


<div class='center'><br />VIII.</div>

<p>It is very easy to mistake the nominative when
another noun comes between it and the verb, which is
frequently the case in the use of the indefinite and
distributive pronouns; as, "One of those houses <i>were</i>
sold last week," "Each of the daughters <i>are</i> to have
a separate share," "Every tree in those plantations
<i>have</i> been injured by the storm," "Either of the children
<i>are</i> at liberty to claim it." Here it will be perceived
that the pronouns "one," "each," "every,"
"either," are the true nominatives to the verbs; but
the intervening noun in the plural number, in each
sentence, deludes the ear, and the speaker, without
reflection, renders the verb in the plural instead of the
singular number. The same error is often committed
when no second noun appears to plead an apology for
the fault; as, "Each city <i>have their</i> peculiar privileges,"
"Everybody has a right to look after <i>their</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
own interest," "Either <i>are</i> at liberty to claim it."
This is the effect of pure carelessness.</p>


<div class='center'><br />IX.</div>

<p>There is another very common error, the reverse
of the last mentioned, which is that of rendering the
adjective pronoun in the <i>plural</i> number instead of the
singular in such sentences as the following: "<i>These</i>
kind of entertainments are not conducive to general
improvement," "<i>Those</i> sort of experiments are often
dangerous." This error seems to originate in the
habit which people insensibly acquire of supposing
the prominent noun in the sentence (such as "entertainments"
or "experiments") to be the noun qualified
by the adjective "these" or "those;" instead of
which it is "kind," "sort," or any word of that
description <i>immediately following</i> the adjective, which
should be so qualified, and the adjective must be
made to agree with it in the singular number. We
confess it is not so agreeable to the ear to say, "<i>This</i>
kind of entertainments," "<i>That</i> sort of experiments;"
but it would be easy to give the sentence a different
form, and say, "Entertainments of this kind," "Experiments
of that sort," by which the requisitions of
grammar would be satisfied, and those of euphony too.</p>


<div class='center'><br />X.</div>

<p>But the grand fault, the glaring impropriety, committed
by "all ranks and conditions of men," rich<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
and poor, high and low, illiterate and learned,&mdash;except,
perhaps, one in twenty,&mdash;and from which not
even the pulpit or the bar is totally free,&mdash;is, the
substitution of the active verb <i>lay</i> for the neuter verb
<i>lie</i> (to lie down). The scholar <i>knows</i> that "active
verbs govern the objective case," and therefore <i>demand</i>
an objective case after them; and that neuter
verbs <i>will not admit</i> an objective case after them,
<i>except</i> through the medium of a preposition. <i>He</i>,
therefore, has no excuse for his error, it is a wilful
one; for him the following is not written. And here
I may as well say, once for all, that whilst I would
<i>remind</i> the <i>scholar</i> of his lapses, my instructions and
explanations are offered <i>only</i> to the class which requires
them.</p>

<p>"To lay" is an active transitive verb, like <i>love</i>,
<i>demanding</i> an objective case after it, <i>without the
intervention of a preposition</i>. "To lie" is a neuter
verb, <i>not admitting an objective case after it, except
through the intervention of a preposition;</i>&mdash;yet this
"perverse generation" <i>will</i> go on substituting the
former for the latter. Nothing can be more erroneous
than to say, as people constantly do, "I shall go and
lay down." The question which naturally arises in
the mind of the discriminating hearer is, "<i>What</i> are
you going to lay down,&mdash;money, carpets, plans, or
what?" for, as a transitive verb is used, an object is
wanted to complete the sense. The speaker means,
in fact, to tell us that he (himself) is going to <i>lie<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
down</i>, instead of which he gives us to understand that
he is going to <i>lay</i> down or <i>put</i> down something which
he has not named, but which it is necessary to name
before we can understand the sentence; and this sentence,
when completed according to the rules of grammar,
will never convey the meaning he intends. One
might as well use the verb "to put" in this situation,
as the verb "to lay," for each is a transitive verb,
requiring an objective case immediately after it. If
you were to enter a room, and, finding a person lying
on the sofa, were to address him with such a question
as "What are you doing there?" you would think it
ludicrous if he were to reply, "I am <i>putting</i> down;"
yet it would not be more absurd than to say, "I am
<i>laying</i> down;" but custom, whilst it fails to reconcile
us to the error, has so familiarized us with it, that we
hear it without surprise, and good breeding forbids our
noticing it to the speaker. The same mistake is committed
through all the tenses of the verb. How often
are nice ears wounded by the following expressions,&mdash;"My
brother <i>lays</i> ill of a fever,"&mdash;"The vessel
<i>lays</i> in St. Katharine's Docks,"&mdash;"The books were
<i>laying</i> on the floor,"&mdash;"He <i>laid</i> on a sofa three
weeks,"&mdash;"After I had <i>laid</i> down, I remembered
that I had left my pistols <i>laying</i> on the table." You
must perceive that, in every one of these instances,
the wrong verb is used; correct it, therefore, according
to the explanation given; thus, "My brother <i>lies</i>
ill of a fever,"&mdash;"The vessel <i>lies</i> in St Katherine's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
Docks,"&mdash;"The books were <i>lying</i> on the floor,"&mdash;"He
<i>lay</i> on a sofa three weeks,"&mdash;"After I had <i>lain</i>
down, I remembered that I had left my pistols <i>lying</i>
on the table."</p>

<p>It is probable that this error has originated in the
circumstance of the present tense of the verb "to
lay" being conjugated precisely like the imperfect
tense of the verb "to lie," for they are alike in orthography
and sound, and different only in meaning; and
in order to remedy the evil which this resemblance
seems to have created, I have conjugated at full length
the simple tenses of the two verbs, hoping the exposition
may be found useful; for it is an error which
<i>must</i> be corrected by all who aspire to the merit of
speaking their own language <i>well</i>.</p>

<p>In such sentences as these, wherein the verb is used
reflectively,&mdash;"If I lay myself down on the grass I
shall catch cold," "He laid himself down on the
green sward,"&mdash;the verb "to lay" is with propriety
substituted for the verb "to lie;" for the addition
of the emphatic pronoun <i>myself</i>, or <i>himself</i>, constituting
an objective case, and coming <i>immediately
after</i> the verb, <i>without the intervention of a preposition</i>,
renders it necessary that the verb employed
should be <i>active</i>, not <i>neuter</i>, because "active verbs
govern the objective case." But this is the only construction
in which "to lay" instead of "to lie" can
be sanctioned by the rules of grammar.</p>


<div class='center'><br />XI.</div>

<p>The same confusion often arises in the use of the
verbs <i>sit</i> and <i>set</i>, <i>rise</i> and <i>raise</i>. <i>Sit</i> is a neuter
verb, <i>set</i> an active one; yet how often do people most
improperly say, "I have <i>set</i> with him for hours,"
"He <i>set</i> on the beach till the sun went down," "She
<i>set</i> three nights by the patient's bedside." What did
they set,&mdash;potatoes, traps, or what? for as an objective
case is evidently implied by the use of an active
verb, an object is indispensable to complete the sense.
No tense whatever of the verb "to sit" is rendered
"set," which has but <i>one word</i> throughout the whole
verb, except the active participle "setting;" and
"sit" has but two words, "sit" and "sat," except
the active participle "sitting;" therefore it is very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
easy to correct this error by the help of a little attention.</p>


<div class='center'><br />XII.</div>

<p><i>Raise</i> is the same kind of verb as <i>set</i>,&mdash;active-transitive,
requiring an objective case after it; and it
contains only two words, <i>raise</i> and <i>raised</i>, besides
the active participle <i>raising</i>. <i>Rise</i> is a neuter verb,
not admitting an objective case. It contains two
words, <i>rise</i> and <i>rose;</i> besides the two participles,
<i>rising</i> and <i>risen</i>. It is improper, therefore, to say,
"He <i>rose</i> the books from the floor," "He <i>rises</i> the
fruit as it falls," "After she had <i>risen</i> the basket on
her head," &amp;c. In all such cases use the other verb
<i>raise</i>. It occurs to me, that if people would take the
trouble to reckon how many different words a verb
contains, they would be in less danger of mistaking
them. "Lay" contains two words, "lay" and "laid,"
besides the active participle "laying." "Lie" has
also two words, "lie" and "lay," besides the two
participles "lying" and "lain;" and from this second
word "lay" arises all the confusion I have had to
lament in the foregoing pages.</p>


<div class='center'><br />XIII.</div>

<p>To the scholar I would remark the prevalent impropriety
of adopting the subjunctive instead of the
indicative mood, in sentences where doubt or uncertainty
is expressed, although the former can only be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
used in situations in which "contingency and futurity"
are combined. Thus, a gentleman, giving an order
to his tailor, may say, "Make me a coat of a certain
description, if it <i>fit</i> me well I will give you another
order;" because the "fit" alluded to is a thing which
the future has to determine. But when the coat is
made and brought home, he cannot say, "If this cloth
<i>be good</i> I will give you another order," for the quality
of the cloth is <i>already</i> determined; the future will
not alter it. It may be good, it may be bad, but
whatever it <i>may be</i> it already <i>is;</i> therefore, as contingency
only is implied, <i>without futurity</i>, it must be
rendered in the indicative mood, "If this cloth <i>is</i>
good," &amp;c. We may with propriety say, "If the
book be sent in time, I shall be able to read it to-night,"
because the sending of the book is an event
which the <i>future</i> must produce; but we must not say,
"If this book be sent for me, it is a mistake," because
here the act alluded to is already performed,&mdash;the
book has come. I think it very likely that people
have been beguiled into this error by the prefix of the
conjunction, forgetting that conjunctions may be used
with the indicative as well as with the subjunctive
mood.</p>


<div class='center'><br />XIV.</div>

<p>Some people use the imperfect tense of the verb
"to go," instead of the past participle, and say, "I
should have <i>went</i>," instead of "I should have gone."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
This is <i>not</i> a very common error, but it is a very
great one; and I should not have thought it could
come within the range of the class for which this
book is written, but that I have heard the fault committed
by people of even tolerable education. One
might as well say, "I should have <i>was</i> at the theatre
last night," instead of "I should have <i>been</i> at the
theatre," &amp;c., as say, "I should have <i>went</i>" instead
of "I should have <i>gone</i>."</p>


<div class='center'><br />XV.</div>

<p>Others there are who invert this error, and use the
past participle of the verb "to do" instead of a tense
of the verb, saying, "I <i>done</i>" instead of "I <i>did</i>."
This is inadmissible. "I <i>did</i> it," or "I <i>have done</i> it,"
is a phrase correct in its formation, its application
being, of course, dependent on other circumstances.</p>


<div class='center'><br />XVI.</div>

<p>There are speakers who are <i>too refined</i> to use the
past (or perfect) participle of the verbs "to drink,"
"to run," "to begin," &amp;c., and substitute the <i>imperfect
tense</i>, as in the verb "to go." Thus, instead of
saying, "I have drunk," "he has run," "they have
begun," they say, "I have <i>drank</i>" "he has <i>ran</i>,"
"they have <i>began</i>" &amp;c. These are minor errors, I
admit; still, nice ears detect them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>


<div class='center'><br />XVII.</div>

<p>I trust it is unnecessary to warn any of my readers
against adopting the flagrant vulgarity of saying
"<i>don't</i> ought," and "<i>hadn't</i> ought," instead of "ought
<i>not</i>." It is also incorrect to employ <i>no</i> for <i>not</i> in
such phrases as, "If it is true or <i>no</i> (not)," "Is it so
or <i>no</i> (not)?"</p>


<div class='center'><br />XVIII.</div>

<p>Many people have an odd way of saying, "I expect,"
when they only mean "I think," or "I conclude;"
as, "I expect my brother is gone to Richmond
to-day," "I expect those books were sent to Paris
last year." This is wrong. <i>Expect</i> can relate only
to <i>future</i> time, and must be followed by a future
tense, or a verb in the infinitive mood; as, "I expect
my brother <i>will go</i> to Richmond to-day," "I expect
<i>to find</i> those books were sent to Paris last year."
Here the introduction of a future tense, or of a verb
in the infinitive mood, rectifies the grammar without
altering the sense; but such a portion of the sentence
must not be omitted in expression, as no such ellipsis
is allowable.</p>


<div class='center'><br />XIX.</div>

<p>The majority of speakers use the imperfect tense
and the perfect tense together, in such sentences as
the following,&mdash;"I intended to <i>have called</i> on him
last night," "I meant to <i>have purchased</i> one yesterday,"&mdash;or
a pluperfect tense, and a perfect tense<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
together I have sometimes heard, as, "You should
<i>have written</i> to <i>have told</i> her." These expressions
are illogical, because, as the <i>intention</i> to perform an
act <i>must</i> be <i>prior</i> to the act contemplated, the act
itself cannot with propriety be expressed by a tense
indicating a period of time <i>previous</i> to the intention.
The three sentences should be corrected thus, placing
the second verb in the infinitive mood, "I intended <i>to
call</i> on him last night," "I meant <i>to purchase</i> one
yesterday," "You should have written <i>to tell</i> her."</p>

<p>But the imperfect tense and the perfect tense are to
be combined in such sentences as the following, "I
remarked that they appeared to have undergone great
fatigue;" because here the act of "undergoing
fatigue" <i>must</i> have taken place <i>previous</i> to the period
in which you have had the opportunity of remarking
its effect on their appearance; the sentence, therefore,
is both grammatical and logical.</p>


<div class='center'><br />XX.</div>

<p>Another strange perversion of grammatical propriety
is to be heard occasionally in the adoption of
the present tense of the verb "to have," most probably
instead of the past participle, but in situations in
which the participle itself would be a redundance;
such as, "If I had <i>have</i> known," "If he had <i>have</i>
come according to appointment," "If you had <i>have</i>
sent me that intelligence," &amp;c. Of what utility is the
word "have" in the sentence at all? What office<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
does it perform? If it stands in place of any other
word, that other word would still be an incumbrance;
but the sentence being complete without it, it becomes
an illiterate superfluity. "If I had <i>have</i> known that
you would have been there before me, I would have
written to you to <i>have</i> waited till I had <i>have</i> come."
What a construction from the lips of an educated
person! and yet we do sometimes hear this <i>slip-slop</i>
uttered by people who are considered to "speak
French and Italian <i>well</i>," and who enjoy the reputation
of being "accomplished!"</p>


<div class='center'><br />XXI.</div>

<p>It is amusing to observe the broad line of demarcation
which exists between <i>vulgar</i> bad grammar and
<i>genteel</i> bad grammar, and which characterizes the
violation of almost every rule of syntax. The vulgar
speaker uses adjectives instead of adverbs, and says,
"This letter is written <i>shocking;</i>" the genteel speaker
uses adverbs instead of adjectives, and says, "This
writing looks <i>shockingly</i>." The perpetrators of the
latter offence may fancy they can shield themselves
behind the grammatical law which compels the employment
of an adverb, not an adjective, to qualify
a verb, and behind the first rule of syntax, which
says "a verb must agree with its nominative." But
which <i>is</i> the nominative in the expression alluded to?
<i>Which</i> performs the act of looking,&mdash;the writing or
the speaker? To say that a thing <i>looks</i> when <i>we</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
look <i>at</i> it, is an idiom peculiar to our language, and
some idioms are not reducible to rules; they are conventional
terms which pass current, like bank notes,
for the sterling they represent, but must not be submitted
to the test of grammatical alchymy. It is
improper, therefore, to say, "The queen looks beautifully,"
"The flowers smell sweetly," "This writing
looks shockingly;" because it is the speaker that
performs the act of looking, smelling, &amp;c., not the
noun looked <i>at;</i> and though, by an idiomatical construction
necessary to avoid circumlocution, the sentence
<i>imputes the act</i> to the <i>thing beheld</i>, the qualifying
word must express the quality of the thing spoken
of, <i>adjectively</i>, instead of qualifying the act of the
nominative understood, <i>adverbially</i>. What an adjective
is to a noun, an adverb is to a verb; an adjective
expresses the quality of a thing, and an adverb the
manner of an action. Consider what it is you wish
to express, the <i>quality of a thing</i>, or the <i>manner of
an action</i>, and use an adjective or adverb accordingly.
But beware that you discriminate justly; for though
you cannot say, "The queen looked <i>majestically</i> in
her robes," because here the act of <i>looking</i> is performed
by the spectator, who looks <i>at</i> her, you can
and <i>must</i> say, "The queen looked <i>graciously</i> on the
petitioner," "The queen looked <i>mercifully</i> on his
prayer," because here the <i>act</i> of <i>looking</i> is performed
<i>by</i> the queen. You cannot say, "These flowers smell
sweetly," because it is <i>you</i> that smell, and not the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
flowers; but you can say, "These flowers perfume
the air deliciously," because it is <i>they</i> which impart
the fragrance, not you. You cannot say, "This
dress looks badly," because it is you that look, not
the dress; but you can say, "This dress <i>fits</i> badly,"
because it is the dress that performs the act of fitting
either well or ill. There are some peculiar idioms
which it would be better to avoid altogether, if possible;
but if you feel compelled to use them, take
them as they are,&mdash;you cannot prune and refine
them by the rules of syntax, and to attempt to do so
shows ignorance as well as affectation.</p>


<div class='center'><br />XXII.</div>

<p>There is a mistake often committed in the use of
the adverbs of place, <i>hence</i>, <i>thence</i>, <i>whence</i>. People
are apt to say, "He will go <i>from thence</i> to-morrow,"
&amp;c. The preposition "from" is included in these
adverbs, therefore it becomes tautology in sense when
prefixed to them.</p>


<div class='center'><br />XXIII.</div>

<p>"Equally as well" is a very common expression,
and a very incorrect one; the adverb of comparison,
"as," has no right in the sentence. "Equally well,"
"Equally high," "Equally dear," should be the construction;
and if a complement be necessary in the
phrase, it should be preceded by the preposition
"with," as, "The wall was equally high with the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
former one," "The goods at Smith's are equally dear
with those sold at the shop next door," &amp;c. "Equally
the same" is tautology.</p>


<div class='center'><br />XXIV.</div>

<p>"Whether," sometimes an adverb, sometimes a
conjunction, is a word that plainly indicates a choice
of things (of course I cannot be supposed to mean a
<i>freedom</i> of choice); it is highly improper, therefore,
to place it, as many do, at the head of each part of a
sentence, as, "I have not yet made up my mind
whether I shall go to France, or <i>whether</i> I shall remain
in England." The conjunction should not be repeated,
as it is evident the alternative is expressed
<i>only in the combination</i> of the <i>two</i> parts of the sentence,
not in either of them taken separately; and the
phrase should stand thus, "I have not yet made up
my mind whether I shall go to France <i>or</i> remain in
England."</p>


<div class='center'><br />XXV.</div>

<p>There is an awkwardness prevalent amongst all
classes of society in such sentences as the following:
"He quitted his horse, and got <i>on to</i> a stage coach,"
"He jumped <i>on to</i> the floor," "She laid it <i>on to</i> a
dish," "I threw it <i>on to</i> the fire." Why use two
prepositions where one would be quite as explicit, and
far more elegant? Nobody, at the present day,
would think of saying, "He came up to London <i>for</i>
to go to the exhibition," because the preposition<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
"for" would be an awkward superfluity. So is
"to" in the examples given; in each of which there
is an unwieldiness of construction which reminds one
of the process of glueing, or fastening, one thing "on
to" another. Expunge the redundant preposition,
and be assured, gentle reader, the sentence will still
be found "an elegant sufficiency." There are some
situations, however, in which the two prepositions
may with propriety be employed, though they are
never indispensable, as, "I accompanied such a one
to Islington, and then walked on to Kingsland." But
here <i>two</i> motions are implied, the walking onward,
and the reaching of a certain point. More might be
said to illustrate the distinction, but we believe it
will not be deemed necessary.</p>


<div class='center'><br />XXVI.</div>

<p>There seems to be a natural tendency to deal in a
redundance of prepositions. Many people talk of
"continuing <i>on</i>." I should be glad to be informed in
what other direction it would be possible to <i>continue</i>.</p>


<div class='center'><br />XXVII.</div>

<p>It is most illiterate to put the preposition <i>of</i> after
the adverb <i>off</i>, as, "The satin measured twelve yards
before I cut this piece <i>off of</i> it," "The fruit was gathered
<i>off of</i> that tree." Many of my readers will
consider such a remark quite unnecessary in this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
volume; but many others, who ought to know better,
must stand self-condemned on reading it.</p>


<div class='center'><br />XXVIII.</div>

<p>There is a false taste extant for the preposition
"on" instead of "<i>of</i>" in songs, poetry, and many
other situations in which there is still less excuse for
borrowing the poetic license; such as, "Wilt thou
think <i>on</i> me, love?" "I will think <i>on</i> thee, love,"
"Then think <i>on</i> the friend who once welcomed it
too," &amp;c., &amp;c. But this is an error chiefly to be met
with among poetasters and melodramatic speakers.</p>


<div class='center'><br />XXIX.</div>

<p>Some people add a superfluous preposition at the
end of a sentence,&mdash;"More than you think <i>for</i>."
This, however, is an awkwardness rarely committed
by persons of decent education.</p>


<div class='center'><br />XXX.</div>

<p>That "prepositions govern the objective case" is a
golden rule of grammar; and if it were only <i>well
remembered</i>, it would effectually correct that mistake
of substituting the nominative for the objective pronoun,
which has been complained of in the preceding
pages. In using a relative pronoun in the objective
case, it is more elegant to put the preposition before
than after it, thus, "To whom was the order given?"
instead of, "Whom was the order given to?" Indeed,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
if this practice were to be invariably adopted, it
would obviate the possibility of confounding the nominative
with the objective case, because no man would
ever find himself able to utter such a sentence as,
"To who was this proposal made?" though he might
very unconsciously say, "Who was this proposal
made to?" and the error would be equally flagrant
in both instances.</p>


<div class='center'><br />XXXI.</div>

<p>There is a great inaccuracy connected with the use
of the disjunctive conjunctions <i>or</i> and <i>nor</i>, which
seem to be either not clearly understood, or treated
with undue contempt by persons who speak in the
following manner: "Henry or John <i>are</i> to go there
to-night," "His son or his nephew <i>have</i> since put in
<i>their</i> claim," "Neither one <i>nor</i> the other <i>have</i> the
least chance of success." The conjunctions disjunctive
"or" and "nor" separate the objects in sense,
as the conjunction copulative unites them; and as, by
the use of the former, the things stand forth separately
and singly to the comprehension, the verb or pronoun
must be rendered in the singular number also; as,
"Henry <i>or</i> John <i>is</i> to go there to-night," "His son
<i>or</i> his nephew <i>has</i> since put in <i>his</i> claim," &amp;c. If
you look over the sentence, you will perceive that
only <i>one</i> is to do the act, therefore only <i>one</i> can be
the nominative to the verb.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>


<div class='center'><br />XXXII.</div>

<p>Many people improperly substitute the disjunctive
"but" for the comparative "than," as, "The mind
no sooner entertains any proposition, <i>but</i> it presently
hastens to some hypothesis to bottom it on."&mdash;<i>Locke.</i>
"No other resource <i>but</i> this was allowed him."
"My behavior," says she, "has, I fear, been the
death of a man who had no other fault <i>but</i> that of
loving me too much."&mdash;<i>Spectator.</i></p>


<div class='center'><br />XXXIII.</div>

<p>Sometimes a relative pronoun is used instead of a
conjunction, in such sentences as the following: "I
don't know but <i>what</i> I shall go to Brighton to-morrow,"
instead of, "I don't know but <i>that</i>," &amp;c.</p>


<div class='center'><br />XXXIV.</div>

<p>Sometimes the disjunctive <i>but</i> is substituted for the
conjunction <i>that</i>, as, "I have no doubt <i>but</i> he will be
here to-night." Sometimes for the conjunction <i>if</i>, as,
"I shouldn't wonder <i>but</i> that was the case." And
sometimes <i>two</i> conjunctions are used instead of one,
as, "<i>If that</i> I have offended him," "<i>After that</i> he
had seen the parties," &amp;c. All this is very awkward
indeed, and ought to be avoided, and might easily be
so by a little attention.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>Some people pronounce the plural of handkerchief,

<p>There is an old jest on record of a person hearing
another pronounce the word curiosity "<i>curosity</i>,"
and remarking to a bystander, "That man murders

addressed, "he only knocks an eye (i) out." And I
am invariably reminded of this old jest whenever I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
hear such pronunciations as the following,&mdash;"Lat'n"
for Latin, "sat'n" for satin, and Britain pronounced
so as to rhyme with <i>written</i>,&mdash;of which a few examples
will be given on a subsequent page, not with
the wild hope of comprising in so short a space <i>all</i>
the perversions of prosody which are constantly taking
place, but simply with the intention of reminding
careless speakers of some general principles they
seem to have forgotten, and of the vast accumulation
of error they may engraft upon themselves by a lazy
adherence to the custom of the crowd. Before, however,
proceeding to the words in question, it may be
satisfactory to our readers to recall to their memory
the observations of Lindley Murray on the subject.
He says, "There is scarcely anything which more
distinguishes a person of poor education from a person
of a good one than the pronunciation of the <i>unaccented
vowels</i>. When vowels are <i>under the accent</i>, the best
speakers, and the lowest of the people, with very few
exceptions, pronounce them in the same manner; but
the <i>un</i>accented vowels in the mouths of the former
have a distinct, open, and specific sound, while the
latter often totally sink them, or change them into
some other sound." The words that have chiefly
struck me are the following, in which not only the i
but some of the other vowels are submitted to the
mutilating process, or, as I have heard it pronounced,
<i>mutulating</i>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>And a long train of <i>et cetera</i>, of which the above
examples do not furnish a tithe.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Note.</i>&mdash;That to sound the <i>e</i> in <i>garden</i> and <i>often</i>, and the <i>i</i>
in <i>evil</i> and <i>devil</i>, is a decided error. They should always be
pronounced <i>gard'n</i> and <i>oft'n</i>, <i>ev'l</i> and <i>dev'l</i>.</p></div>

<p>Some people pronounce the <i>I</i> in Irish and its concomitants
so as to make the words Ireland, Irishmen,
Irish linen, &amp;c., sound as if they were written <i>Arland</i>,
<i>A-rishmen</i>, <i>Arish</i> linen, &amp;c. This is literally "knocking
an <i>i</i> out."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>


<div class='center'><br />VI.</div>

<p>It is affected, and contrary to authority, to deprive
the <i>s</i> of its sharp hissing sound in the words <i>precise</i>,
<i>desolate</i>, <i>design</i>, and their derivatives.</p>


<div class='center'><br />VII.</div>

<p>There is one peculiarity which we feel bound to
notice, because it has infected English speakers,&mdash;that
of corrupting the <i>e</i> and the <i>i</i> into the sound of <i>a</i>
or <i>u</i>, in the words ability, humility, charity, &amp;c.; for
how often is the ear wrung by such barbarisms as,
humi<i>lutty</i>, civi<i>lutty</i>, qua<i>laty</i>, quan<i>taty</i>, cru<i>alty</i>, char<i>aty</i>,
human<i>aty</i>, barbar<i>aty</i>, horr<i>uble</i>, terr<i>uble</i>, and so
on, <i>ad infinitum!</i>&mdash;an uncouth practice, to which
nothing is comparable, except pronouncing <i>yalla</i> for
yellow.</p>


<div class='center'><br />VIII.</div>

<p>There is in some quarters a bad mode prevalent of
pronouncing the plural of such words as <i>face</i>, <i>place</i>,
&amp;c., <i>fazes</i>, <i>plazes</i>, whilst the plural of <i>price</i> seems
everywhere subject to the same strange mutation. The
words should be <i>faces</i>, <i>places</i>, <i>prices</i>, without any
softening of the <i>c</i> into <i>z</i>. There is, too, an ugly fashion
of pronouncing the <i>ng</i>, when terminating a word or
syllable, as <i>we</i> pronounce the same combination of
letters in the word <i>finger</i>, and making such words as
"singer," "ringer," &amp;c., rhyme with <i>linger</i>. Sometimes
the double <i>o</i> is elongated into the sound which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
we give to that dipthong in "room," "fool," "moon,"
&amp;c., which has a very bad effect in such words as
<i>book</i>, <i>look</i>, <i>nook</i>, <i>took</i>, &amp;c.; and sometimes it is
contracted into the sound of short <i>u</i>, making "foot,"
and some other words, rhyme with <i>but</i>.</p>


<div class='center'><br />IX.</div>

<p>And having remarked on the <i>lingering</i> pronunciation,
it is but fair to notice a defect, the reverse of
this, namely, that of omitting the final <i>g</i> in such
words as <i>saying</i>, <i>going</i>, <i>shilling</i>, &amp;c., and pronouncing
them "sayin," "goin," "shillin." This is so common
an error that it generally escapes notice, but is a
greater blemish, where we have a right to look for
perfection, than the peculiarities of the provinces in
those who reside there.</p>


<div class='center'><br />X.</div>

<p>It is also a common fault to add a gratuitous <i>r</i> to
words ending with a vowel, such as Emma<i>r</i>, Louisa<i>r</i>,
Julia<i>r</i>, and to make <i>draw</i>, <i>law</i>, <i>saw</i>, <i>flaw</i>, with all
others of the same class, rhyme with <i>war;</i> to omit
the <i>r</i> in such words as <i>corks</i>, <i>forks</i>, <i>curtains</i>, <i>morsel</i>,
&amp;c.; in the word <i>perhaps</i>, when they conscientiously
<i>pronounce</i> the <i>h;</i> and sometimes in <i>Paris;</i> or to convert
it into the sound of a <i>y</i> when it comes between
two vowels, as in the name <i>Harriet</i>, and in the words
<i>superior</i>, <i>interior</i>, &amp;c., frequently pronounced <i>Aah-yet</i>,
<i>su-pe-yor</i>, <i>in-te-yor</i>, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>&amp;c.</p>


<div class='center'><br />XI.</div>

<p>There is a vicious mode of amalgamating the final
<i>s</i> of a word (and sometimes the final <i>c</i>, when preceded
and followed by a vowel) with the first letter of the
next word, if that letter happens to be a <i>y</i>, in such a
manner as to produce the sound of <i>sh</i> or of <i>usu</i> in
<i>usual;</i> as, "A <i>nishe</i> young man," "What <i>makesh</i>
you laugh?" "If he <i>offendsh</i> you, don't speak to
him," "<i>Ash</i> you please," "Not <i>jush</i> yet," "We
always <i>passh</i> your house in going to call on <i>Missh</i>
Yates,&mdash;she lives near <i>Palash</i> Yard;" and so on
through all the possibilities of such a combination.
This is decided, unmitigated <i>cockneyism</i>, having its
parallel in nothing except the broken English of the
sons of Abraham; and to adopt it in conversation is
certainly "not speaking like a Christian." The effect
of this pronunciation on the ear is as though the
mouth of the speaker were filled with froth, which
impedes the utterance, and gives the semblance of a
defect where nature had kindly intended perfection;
but the radical cause of this, and of many other mispronunciations,
is the carelessness, sometimes the
ignorance, of teachers, who permit children to read
and speak in a slovenly manner, without opening
their teeth, or taking any pains to acquire a distinct
articulation.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>


<div class='center'><br />XII.</div>

<p>Whilst we are on the subject of Prosody, we must
not omit to mention the vicious pronunciation occasionally
given to the words <i>new</i>, <i>due</i>, <i>Tuesday</i>, <i>stupid</i>,
and a few others, sometimes corrupted into <i>noo</i>,
<i>doo</i>, <i>Toosday</i>, <i>stoopid</i>, &amp;c., by way of refinement,
perhaps, for lips which are too delicate to utter the
clear, broad, English <i>u</i>.</p>


<div class='center'><br />XIII.</div>

<p>Never say "Cut it in <i>half</i>," for this you cannot do
unless you could <i>annihilate one</i> half. You may "cut
it in two," or "cut it in halves," or "cut it through,"
or "divide it," but no human ability will enable you
to <i>cut it in half</i>.</p>


<div class='center'><br />XIV.</div>

<p>Never speak of "lots" and "loads" of things.
Young men allow themselves a diffusive license of
speech, and of quotation, which has introduced many
words into colloquial style that do not at all tend to
improve or dignify the language, and which, when
heard from <i>ladies</i>' lips, become absolute vulgarisms.
A young man may talk recklessly of "lots of bargains,"
"lots of money," "lots of fellows," "lots of
fun," &amp;c., but a lady may <i>not</i>. Man may indulge in
any latitude of expression within the bounds of sense
and decorum, but woman has a narrower range,&mdash;even
her mirth must be subjected to rule. It may be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
<i>na&iuml;ve</i>, but must never be grotesque. It is not that we
would have <i>primness</i> in the sex, but we would have
refinement. Women are the purer and the more
ornamental part of life, and when <i>they</i> degenerate, the
Poetry of Life is gone.</p>


<div class='center'><br />XV.</div>

<p>"Loads" is a word quite as objectional as "lots,"
unless it can be reduced to a load of <i>something</i>, such
as a <i>ship</i>-load, a <i>wagon</i>-load, a <i>cart</i>-load, a <i>horse</i>-load,
&amp;c. We often hear such expressions as "loads
of shops," "loads of authors," "loads of compliments;"
but as shops, authors, compliments, are
things not usually piled up into loads, either for ships
or horses, we cannot discover the propriety of the
application.</p>


<div class='center'><br />XVI.</div>

<p>Some people, guiltless of those absurdities, commit
a great error in the use of the word <i>quantity</i>, applying
it to things of <i>number</i>, as "a quantity of friends,"
"a quantity of ships," "a quantity of houses," &amp;c.
<i>Quantity</i> can be applied only where <i>bulk</i> is indicated,
as "a quantity of land," "a quantity of timber;" but
we cannot say, "a quantity of fields," "a quantity of
trees," because <i>trees</i> and <i>fields</i> are specific individualities.
Or we may apply it where individualities are
taken in the gross, without reference to modes, as "a
quantity of luggage," "a quantity of furniture;" but
we cannot say "a quantity of boxes," "a quantity of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
chairs and tables," for the same reason which is given
in the former instances. We also apply the term
<i>quantity</i> to those things of number which are too
minute to be taken separately, as "a quantity of
beans," "a quantity of oats," &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>


<div class='center'><br />XVII.</div>

<p>Avoid favorite words and phrases; they betray a
poverty of language or of imagination not creditable
to a cultivated intellect. Some people are so unfortunate
as to find all things <i>vulgar</i> that come "betwixt
the wind and their nobility;" others find them <i>disgusting</i>.
Some are always <i>anticipating</i>, others are
always <i>appreciating</i>. Multitudes are <i>aristocratic</i> in
all their relations, other multitudes are as <i>distingu&eacute;s</i>.
These two words are chiefly patronized by those whose
pretensions in such respects are the most questionable.
To some timid spirits, born under malignant influences
no doubt, most things present an <i>awful</i> appearance,
even though they come in shapes so insignificant
as a cold day or an aching finger. But, thanks to
that happy diversity of Nature which throws light as
well as shadow into the human character, there are
minds of brighter vision and more cheerful temperament,
who behold all things <i>splendid</i>, <i>magnificent</i>,
down to a cup of small beer, or a half-penny orange.
Some people have a grandiloquent force of expression,
thereby imparting a <i>tremendous</i> or <i>thundering</i>
character even to little things. This is truly carrying<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
their conceptions into the sublime,&mdash;sometimes a
step beyond.</p>

<p>We have, however, no intention of particularizing
<i>all</i> the "pet" phrases which salute the ear; but the
enumeration of a few of them may make the <i>candid</i>
culprit smile, and avoid those trifling absurdities for
the future.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>We would, under favor, suggest to the reader the
advantage of not relying too confidently on knowledge
acquired by habit and example alone. There are
many words in constant use which are perverted from
their original meanings; and if we were to dip into
some standard dictionary occasionally, search out the
true meanings of words with which we have fancied
ourselves acquainted, and convict ourselves of <i>all</i> the
errors we have been committing in following the
crowd, our surprise, perhaps, would equal that of
Moli&egrave;re's <i>Bourgeois Gentilhomme</i> when he discovered
that he had been talking <i>prose</i> for forty years.</p>

<p>The words <i>feasible</i>, <i>ostensible</i>, <i>obnoxious</i>, <i>apparent</i>,
<i>obtain</i>, <i>refrain</i>, <i>domesticated</i>, and <i>centre</i>, are expressions
which, nine times out of ten, are misapplied,
besides a host of others whose propriety is never
questioned, so firmly has custom riveted the bonds of
ignorance.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>In closing this little volume, the writer begs leave
to say that the remarks offered are intended only as
"Hints," which they who desire perfection may
easily improve, by a little exercise of the understanding,
and a reference to more extensive sources, into a
competent knowledge of their own tongue; also as
<i>warnings</i> to the careless, that their lapses do not pass
so unobserved as they are in the habit of supposing.</p>

<p>Though many of the syntactical errors herein mentioned
are to be found in the works of some of our
best writers, they are <i>errors</i> nevertheless, and stand
as blemishes upon the productions of their genius,
like unsightly excrescences upon a lovely skin.
Genius is above grammar, and this conviction may
inspire in some bosoms an undue contempt for the
latter. But grammar is a constituent part of good
education, and a neglect of it <i>might</i> argue a <i>want</i> of
education, which would, perhaps, be mortifying. It
is an old axiom that "civility costs nothing," and
surely grammatical purity need not cost <i>much</i> to
people disposed to pay a little attention to it, and who
have received a respectable education already. It
adds a grace to eloquence, and raises the standard of
language where eloquence is not.</p>

<p>A handsome man or handsome woman is not improved
by a shabby or slatternly attire; so the best
abilities are shown to a disadvantage through a style
marked by illiteracies.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<h2>MISTAKES AND IMPROPRIETIES</h2>

<p>IN SPEAKING AND WRITING CORRECTED.</p>

a schoolmaster once to the author of this little work.
<i>Corporeal</i> is opposed to <i>spiritual;</i> say, <i>corporal</i> punishment.

the first syllable of <i>notable</i> as <i>no</i> in <i>notion</i>. Mrs.

<p>91. We <i>conversed together</i> on the subject; leave
out <i>together</i>, as it is implied in <i>conversed</i>, <i>con</i> being

other</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>92. The affair was <i>compromised;</i> pronounce <i>compromised</i>

have found him;</i> say, <i>to find him</i>.</p>

<p>103. I intended <i>to have written</i> a letter yesterday;
say, <i>to write</i>, as however long it now is since I thought
of writing, "<i>to write</i>" was then present to me, and
must still be considered as present when I bring back
that time and the thoughts of it.</p>

<p>104. His death <i>shall be</i> long regretted [from a
notice of a death in a newspaper]; say, <i>will be</i> long,
&amp;c. <i>Shall</i> and <i>will</i> are often confounded; the following
rule, however, may be of use to the reader.
Mere <i>futurity</i> is expressed by <i>shall</i> in the <i>first</i> person,
and by <i>will</i> in the <i>second</i> and <i>third;</i> the <i>determination</i>
of the speaker by <i>will</i> in the <i>first</i>, and <i>shall</i> in
the <i>second</i> and <i>third;</i> as, I <span class="smcap">will</span> go to-morrow, I
<span class="smcap">shall</span> go to-morrow. N. B. The latter sentence
simply expresses a future event; the former expresses
my determination.</p>

<p>105. "<i>Without</i> the grammatical form of a word
can be recognized at a glance, little progress can be

say, <i>chief</i>. <i>Chief</i>, <i>right</i>, <i>supreme</i>, <i>correct</i>, <i>true</i>, <i>universal</i>,
<i>perfect</i>, <i>consummate</i>, <i>extreme</i>, &amp;c., <i>imply</i> the
superlative degree without <i>est</i> or <i>most</i>. In language
sublime or impassioned, however, the word <i>perfect</i>
requires the superlative form to give it effect. A
lover, enraptured with his mistress, would naturally
call her the <i>most perfect</i> of her sex.</p>

<p>113. The <i>yellow</i> part of an egg is very nourishing;
<i>never</i> pronounce <i>yellow</i> like <i>tallow</i>, which we so often
hear.</p>

<p>114. We are going to the <i>zoological</i> gardens; pronounce
<i>zoological</i> in <i>five</i> syllables, and place the
accent on <i>log</i> in <i>logical</i>. Sound <i>log</i> like <i>lodge</i>, and

<i>an</i>, as the <i>h</i> is not sounded; likewise before words
beginning with <i>h</i> that are <i>not</i> accented on the <i>first
syllable</i>, such as <i>heroic</i>, <i>historical</i>, <i>hypothesis</i>, &amp;c., as,
<i>an heroic action</i>, <i>an historical work</i>, <i>an hypothesis</i>
that can scarcely be allowed. N. B. The letter <i>h</i> is
seldom mute at the beginning of a word; but from
the negligence of tutors and the inattention of pupils
many persons have become almost incapable of acquiring
its just and full pronunciation. It is, therefore,
incumbent on teachers to be particularly careful
to inculcate a clear and distinct utterance of this
sound.</p>

<p>242. Some writers make a distinction between <i>farther</i>
and <i>further;</i> they are, in fact, the very same
word. <i>Further</i>, however, is less used than <i>farther</i>,
though it is the genuine form.</p>

<p>243. He did it <i>unbeknown</i> to us; say, <i>unknown</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>244. If I say "They retreated <i>back</i>," I use a word
that is <i>superfluous</i>, as <i>back</i> is implied in the syllable
<i>re</i> in <i>retreated</i>. Never place the accent on <i>flu</i> in
<i>superfluous</i>, but always on <i>per</i>.</p>

<p>245. In reading Paley's "Evidences of Christianity,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
I unexpectedly <i>lit on</i> the passage I wanted;
say, <i>met with</i> the passage, &amp;c.</p>

<p>246. He has ordered a <i>phaeton</i> from his coach-maker;
beware of saying, <i>pheton</i> or <i>phaton</i>. The
word should always be pronounced in <i>three</i> syllables,
with the accent on <i>pha</i>. N. B. In pha-e-ton the <i>a</i>
and <i>e</i> do <i>not</i> form a diphthong, as many suppose; the
word is of Greek origin.</p>

<p>247. Be careful to use the hyphen (-) correctly;
it joins compound words, and words broken by the
ending of the line. The use of the hyphen will appear
more clearly from the following example:
"<i>many colored</i> wings" means <i>many</i> wings, which
are <i>colored;</i> but "<i>many-colored</i> wings" means "wings
of <i>many colors</i>."</p>

<p>248. He had to wait in an <i>antechamber;</i> carefully
avoid spelling the last word <i>antichamber</i>. N. B. An
<i>antechamber</i> is the chamber that leads to the chief
apartment. <i>Ante</i> is a <span class="smcap">Latin preposition</span>, and means
<i>before</i>, as, to ante<i>date</i>, that is, "to date beforehand."
<i>Anti</i> is a <span class="smcap">Greek preposition</span>, and means <i>against</i>, as,
anti<i>monarchical</i>, that is, "against government by a
single person."</p>

<p>249. The <i>axe</i> was very sharp; never spell <i>axe</i>
without the <i>e</i>.</p>

<p>250. The force of voice, which is placed on any
particular word or words to distinguish the sense, is
called <i>emphasis</i> and those words are called <i>emphatical
words:</i> as, "Grammar is a <i>useful</i> science." In this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
sentence the word <i>useful</i> is emphatical. The great
importance of <i>emphasis</i> may be seen by the following
example:</p>

<div class='poem'>
1. Will you <i>call</i> on me to-morrow?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Yes, I shall [<i>call</i>].</span><br />
<br />
2. Will you call on <i>me</i> to-morrow?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">No, but I shall call on your <i>brother</i>.</span><br />
<br />
3. Will you call on me <i>to-morrow?</i><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">No, but I shall on the <i>following day</i>.</span><br />
<br />
4. Will <i>you</i> call on me to-morrow?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">No, but my <i>brother</i> will.</span><br />
</div>

<p>251. Never say <i>o-fences</i> for <i>offences;</i> <i>pison</i> for
<i>poison;</i> <i>co-lection</i> for <i>collection;</i> <i>voiolent</i> for <i>violent;</i>
<i>kiver</i> for <i>cover;</i> <i>afeard</i> for <i>afraid;</i> <i>debbuty</i> for <i>deputy</i>.</p>

<p>252. He is a mere <i>cipher;</i> never spell <i>cipher</i> with
a <i>y</i>.</p>

<p>253. I was <i>necessitated</i> to do it; a vile expression,
and often made worse by <i>necessiated</i> being used.
Say, I was <i>obliged</i>, or <i>compelled</i>, to do it.</p>

<p>254. Gibbon wrote the "<i>Rise</i> and Fall of the
Roman Empire;" pronounce <i>rise</i>, the noun, so as to
rhyme with <i>price;</i> <i>rise</i>, the verb, rhymes with <i>prize</i>.</p>

<p>255. Have you been to the <i>National</i> Gallery?
Never pronounce <i>national</i> as if it were written <i>nay-shun-al</i>,
a very common error, and by no means confined
to uneducated persons.</p>

<p>256. I bought a new <i>umbrella;</i> beware of pronouncing
<i>umbrella</i>, <i>umberella</i>, or <i>umbereller</i>, both very
common errors.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>257. He is a supporter of the <i>government;</i> beware
of omitting the <i>n</i> in the second syllable of <i>government</i>.
A very common practice.</p>

<p>258. He strenuously maintained the <i>contrary;</i> never
place the accent on the <i>second</i> syllable in <i>contrary</i>.
In the ancient and time-honored ditty, however, of</p>

<div class='poem'>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">"Mistress Mary,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Quite <i>contrary</i>,</span><br />
How does your garden grow?"<br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>a ballad with which we are all more or less familiar,
the word "<i>contrary</i>" <i>is</i> accented on the <i>second</i> syllable,
so as to rhyme with the name of the venerable
dame to whom these memorable lines were addressed.</div>

<p>259. "Received this day <i>of</i> Mr. Brown, ten pounds;"
say, "Received this day <i>from</i>", &amp;c.</p>

<p>260. "In what case is the word <i>dominus?</i>" "In
the <i>nominative</i>, sir." In the hurry of school pronunciation
"<i>nominative</i>" is nearly always heard in <i>three</i>
syllables, as if written <i>nomnative</i> or <i>nomative</i>, an error
that should be very carefully avoided; it is a word of
<i>four</i> syllables.</p>

<p>261. Of whatever you <i>get</i>, endeavor to save something;
and, with all your <i>getting</i>, <i>get</i> wisdom. Carefully
avoid saying <i>git</i> for <i>get</i>, and <i>gitting</i> for <i>getting</i>.</p>

<p>262. So intent was he on the song he was <i>singing</i>,
as he stood by the fire, that he did not perceive that
his clothes were <i>singeing</i>. N. B. Verbs ending with
a <i>single e</i> omit the <i>e</i> when the termination <i>ing</i> is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
added; as, <i>give</i>, <i>giving</i>. In <i>singeing</i>, however, the <i>e</i>
must be retained, to prevent its being confounded
with <i>singing</i>.</p>

<p>263. The boy had a <i>swingeing</i> for <i>swinging</i> without
permission. <i>Read the preceding note.</i></p>

<p>264. The man who was <i>dyeing</i> said that his father
was then <i>dying</i>. Read the note in No. 262, in reference
to <i>dyeing;</i> and observe that <i>die</i> changes the <i>i</i>
into <i>y</i> before the addition of the termination <i>ing</i>.</p>

<p>265. His <i>surname</i> is Clifford; never spell the <i>sur</i>
in <i>surname</i>, <i>sir</i>, which shows an ignorance of is true
derivation, which is from the Latin.</p>

<p>266. In "Bell's Life in London," of Saturday, Jan.
13th, of the current year [1855], there is a letter
from a Scotchman to the editor on the subject of the
declining salmon fisheries in Scotland. In one passage
the writer thus expresses himself: "The Duke
of Sutherland has got <i>almost no rent</i> for these [salmon]
rivers for the last four years," &amp;c. The writer should
have said, <i>scarcely any rent</i>. "<i>Almost no rent</i>" is a
downright Scotticism.</p>

<p>267. His <i>mamma</i> sent him to a preparatory school;
<i>mamma</i> is often written with one <i>m</i> only, which is
not, as may at first be supposed, in imitation of the
French [<i>maman</i>], but in sheer ignorance. The word
is pure Greek.</p>

<p>268. Active verbs often take a neuter sense; as,
<i>The house is building</i>. Here <i>is building</i> is used in a
neuter signification, because it has no object after it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
By this rule are explained such sentences as, <i>Application
is wanting</i>, <i>The grammar is printing</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>269. He <i>attackted</i> me without the slightest provocation;
say, <i>attacked</i>.</p>

<p>270. I saw him <i>somewheres</i> in the city; say, <i>somewhere</i>.
N. B. <i>Nowheres</i>, <i>everywheres</i>, and <i>anywheres</i>
are also very frequently heard.</p>

<p>271. He is still a <i>bacheldor;</i> say, <i>bachelor</i>.</p>

<p>272. His language was quite <i>blasphemous;</i> beware
of placing the accent on <i>phe</i> in <i>blasphemous</i>. A very
common mistake. Place the accent on the syllable
<i>blas</i>.</p>

<p>273. I fear I shall <i>discommode</i> you; say, <i>incommode</i>.</p>

<p>274. I can do it <i>equally as well as</i> he; leave out
<i>equally</i>, which is altogether superfluous.</p>

<p>275. We could not forbear <i>from</i> doing it; leave
out <i>from</i>, which is unnecessary.</p>

<p>276. They accused him <i>for</i> neglecting his duty;
say, <i>of</i> neglecting, &amp;c.</p>

<p>277. He was made much <i>on</i> at Bath; say, made
much <i>of</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>278. He is a man <i>on</i> whom you can confide; say,

think</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>280. He was obliged to <i>fly</i> the country; say, <i>flee</i>
the country. A very common mistake.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>281. The snuffers <i>wants</i> mending; say, <i>want</i>
mending.</p>

<p>282. His conduct admits <i>of</i> no apology; leave out
<i>of</i>, which is quite unnecessary.</p>

<p>283. A <i>gent</i> has been here, inquiring for you,&mdash;a
detestable, but very common, expression; say, a
<i>gentleman</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>284. That was <i>all along of</i> you; say, That was <i>all
your fault</i>.</p>

<p>285. You have no <i>call</i> to be vexed with me; say,
no <i>occasion</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>286. I <i>don't</i> know nothing about it,&mdash;a very common
cockneyism; leave out <i>don't</i>.</p>

<p>287. I <i>had</i> rather not, should be, I <i>would</i> rather

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
